This marked an important development as it conferred international legitimacy on the agreement signed in Qatar on Feb 29. But other developments have been far more consequential for the peace process, already at a standstill following a series of setbacks.\nThe inability to start intra-Afghan talks slated for March 10, deadlock over the prisoners’ release issue and the rival inauguration ceremonies of the Afghan president on March 9 — all underline how fraught the post-Doha situation has turned out to be. This raises serious questions about the future of the peace process as envisaged by the Doha accord.\nWhile considering the ramifications of these developments it is important to keep in view the limits of the Doha agreement. This is indicated by its purposively vague nature in some respects and the obvious fact that it excluded the Afghan government with whom Washington signed a separate declaration.\nThe crux of the Doha agreement is Washington’s commitment to a total but phased withdrawal in return for the Taliban’s commitment to prevent Afghanistan’s soil from being used by terrorists and agreeing to intra-Afghan talks. The rest consists of aspirational goals and timelines, with the Afghan parties left with the responsibility to negotiate a ceasefire and a political settlement to end the war.\nDelay in starting intra-Afghan talks increases the risk of the Doha peace plan being derailed.\nThe agreement calls for intra-Afghan talks to begin on March 10 and assumes their progress but does not indicate when they are to conclude. It also does not specify when the new Islamic government is to be formed — within the 14-month period committed for the drawdown of US forces or after?\nAs many analysts have pointed out, for President Donald Trump the agreement to bring troops home ahead of the American presidential election (less than eight months away) is driven by domestic political calculations rather than any strategic thinking. It enables him to deliver on his pledge to disengage America from an “endless war”.\nThis implies that his determination to pull out of Afghanistan appears to have priority over whether the negotiating process is able to yield enduring peace. From the Doha agreement and Trump’s statements it seems that the US may even be prepared to contemplate leaving Afghanistan without any meaningful long-term commitment. At the declaratory level, Washington will continue to assert that the drawdown is conditions-based until full implementation of the agreement, but President Trump is hardly likely to change his long-held view that Afghanistan is a quagmire from which an exit, not staying on, is the best course. “Countries,” he said after the Doha deal, “have to take care of themselves. You can only hold someone’s hand for so long.”\nDisagreement over the prisoners’ release, which the Taliban insist is a prerequisite for   commencement of an intra-Afghan dialogue, has become the immediate obstacle in the peace process. But a bigger challenge is the political crisis sparked by the clash between Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah over the disputed presidential election.\nIf not expeditiously addressed, the tussle can snowball into a bigger crisis. This would further delay intra-Afghan talks at a time when the US withdrawal is already under way while the Taliban have resumed operations against government forces and vice versa.\nSeveral questions are raised by these developments. Will the start of the US drawdown mount enough pressure on Ghani and Abdullah to reconcile their differences and agree on a common negotiating team for intra-Afghan talks?\nHow engaged will the US be at this time to press the Afghan parties to compromise, preoccupied as it is, like other countries, with tackling the coronavirus emergency? Will a prolonged hiatus in peace talks unravel efforts to end the war especially if there is a renewal of significant violence?\nFor now, Ghani seems intent on using the prisoners issue as leverage to strengthen his hand with Washington and press Abdullah to back down and accept him as the legitimate president. This brinkmanship, against the backdrop of parallel governments and regional leaders lining up with one or other side, risks further destabilising the situation and imperilling the peace process.\nMeanwhile, the Taliban, while renewing attacks on government forces, have sought to demonstrate that they are sticking to their deal with the Americans. On March 14, the Taliban reiterated their commitment to eliminate the Islamic State (Daesh), which was promptly welcomed by US special representative, Zalmay Khalilzad as a “positive step”.\nNevertheless, the longer the delay in starting intra-Afghan negotiations the greater the risk of the peace plan mapped out at Doha being derailed and the country descending into political chaos.\nWhile Covid-19 will impose obvious limits on diplomatic efforts, Khalilzad has used it to press the urgency of resolving the prisoners dispute.\nYet despite his prolonged stay in Kabul, he has been unable so far, to overcome the impasse on both the prisoners issue and parallel governments. Nato, meanwhile, has expressed concern at the political turmoil.\nFor Pakistan it is imperative to accurately anticipate the likely scenarios that may evolve and be ready with a whole-of-government approach to respond to them. This exercise should neither be guided by wishful nor short-term thinking.\nThe best-case scenario of course is that the principal parties adhere to the agreement, work to reduce violence and defeat the machinations of domestic and regional spoilers even if the timelines change and stated positions are modified in order to make the arrangement work.\nHowever, the risk of other scenarios materialising may be higher, in which the road map laid out at Doha is upended by the collapse of intra-Afghan negotiations or the failure of talks to resolve core issues even if the dialogue can somehow get going. This could lead to a resurgence of violence which may in turn compel a reluctant US to slow down its withdrawal with unpredictable consequences.\nAll this serves as a telling reminder that winning the peace is always much harder than waging war."}]}

Ensure the article presents a nuanced perspective on the subject, incorporates geopolitical insights, and maintains a formal, insightful tone."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "WHY write about soft power at a time of the Covid-19 crisis?\nBecause the global health emergency helps to illustrate its significance and impact. It also makes sense to evaluate the importance of soft power for Pakistan’s diplomacy in the post-pandemic world.\nIf soft power is understood as a country’s attributes or behaviour that appeals to others and creates positive perceptions, then consider the case of China in the midst of the ongoing coronavirus crisis. China’s remarkably successful fight to contain the virus and then extend help to over 80 countries set an example admired the world over, notwithstanding the stigmatising rhetoric from its detractors.\nWhat does that mean?\nIt means that by its example and subsequent actions for the collective good, China created a soft power effect. In other words, by earning respect from its conduct, China managed to elevate its global position. This underlines how soft power can be instrumental in enhancing a country’s influence and international standing.\nTurning now to consideration of the utility of soft power, the evidence is overwhelming. When soft power is deployed as a pivotal part of a country’s diplomatic strategy it pays rich dividends, enabling that country to build trust and influence and thus more effectively promote its foreign policy goals.\nPakistan needs to step up its diplomatic game and act strategically.\nWe have long known that perceptions are consequential to a country’s standing in global affairs. Soft power can be an indispensable, cost-effective tool to shape perceptions that can encourage cooperation from the international community.\nAs others have also pointed out, the international standing of a country today depends as much on perceptions of it and its reputation as its military and economic power. The growing shift in recent decades from hard power to the importance of soft power means that being ‘liked’ helps nations to increase their clout in international affairs.\nThe term soft power is used rather imprecisely in Pakistan. It is conceived in a limited way by policymakers and often misinterpreted in popular discourse.\nThe term and notion are owed of course to the American scholar Joseph Nye, who in a seminal work in 1990 described soft power as the ability to shape the preferences of others and secure outcomes through “attraction rather than coercion or payments”. He counterposed soft power, “the power of persuasion and co-option”, to the “power of coercion” represented by the hard power of military and economic strength. And he identified culture, political values and foreign policy as the principal sources of soft power. Subsequent literature expanded on the concept. A prolific debate ensued on the diverse sources, dimensions and measures by which to assess soft power. Much of this remained West-centric, but there were lessons for the ‘rest’ to draw on.\nA Soft Power Summit, organised recently by Brand Finance in London, where I was also invited to speak, attracted participants from 100 countries, reflecting the wide interest the subject attracts. The keynote from former UN secretary general Ban-Ki Moon set the tone: “Soft power is an essential ingredient in international diplomacy now more important than ever.”\nSpeakers generated a rich debate especially around the Global Soft Power Index 2020 report launched by Brand Finance. This identifies seven Soft Power Pillars and ranks 60 countries according to measures that include performance on these pillars, reputation, awareness, familiarity and overall influence. It is based on responses to these of over 55,000 people from around 100 countries. The seven pillars are business and trade, governance, international relations, culture and heritage, media and communication, education and science, people and values.\nWestern countries are among the top five in the ranking index, with Japan and China at four and five. Pakistan figures among the bottom 10, at 53 out of 60. India at 27 is described as underperforming. Singapore is the top Southeast Asian nation at 20, drawing soft power from its perception as a leader in education and science. One can debate the measures used and question the methodology of such surveys, but there is much to learn from them.\nI experienced firsthand the critical role soft power can play in achieving a specific diplomatic goal when I served as Pakistan’s envoy at the UN in New York. With 193 countries represented at the UN, it is an ideal global platform to execute soft power strategies. Many countries do that on a sustained basis.\nIn Pakistan’s case, we had to win election to a key UN body two years ago. Competition was tough. So was the challenge, as the electorate was the 193-member General Assembly. In Africa and Latin America, we have few diplomatic missions and little or no representation in the 38 Small Island Deve­loping States (SIDS). All have a vote and every vote counts.\nWhat did we do in addition to traditional lobbying and making reciprocal arrangements? We deployed soft power resources in two ways. We undertook intense cultural diplomacy by hosting events that showcased our rich heritage and we projected Pakistan’s international role as a force for good by our contribution to UN Peacekeeping (critical for Africa). Cultural diplomacy involved a packed concert in the prestigious General Assembly hall, a Pakistani ‘street food’ event, and a colourful (first-ever) celebration of Eid at the UN. Our peacekeeping role was showcased in different ways including a photo exhibition at the UN. All this aimed to appeal to ‘voters’ by projection of the soft power of our culture and our policies that contribute to global peace and security. Pakistan won the election, polling 151 votes — much more than were needed. Soft power efforts had played a key role in this outcome.\nLooking ahead, Pakistan needs to step up its diplomatic game and act strategically. There seems to be a reluctance to change how we conduct our diplomacy when a hyperconnected and multipolar world offers unprecedented opportunities to influence multiple actors across the globe. Today, ‘nation branding’ is essential. Policymakers should identify and imaginatively incorporate our soft power resources into our foreign policy, engaging more vigorously in public diplomacy to shape the narrative abroad. There is no reason why Pakistan should remain at the bottom of the Global Soft Power League."}]}

However, several months into the global health emergency, lessons have emerged from across the world to show what worked to mitigate and contain Covid-19 — and what did not. It is never too late for a government to change course even in the midst of an uncharted and evolving crisis, especially as more evidence emerges about how best to tackle it.\nBy now, the most obvious and instructive lesson is that it is “rapid, decisive and collective action that can prevent the spread” — as an influential report from London’s Imperial College put it.\nAnd this advice from the World Health Organisation remains imperative to fight the virus: “Countries must continue to find, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact”. And “If countries rush to lift restrictions too quickly, the virus could resurge and the economic impact could be even more severe and prolonged”.\nInformed by this perspective, the prime minister might consider taking the following five steps: 1) send clear, coherent and consistent messages to the public; 2) act decisively; 3) lead a unified, multilayered, national effort with close coordination with all provinces; 4) stay a firm course on social distancing; and above all 5) be guided by the evolving medical science on the pandemic by giving a lead role to medical specialists who understand this, not generalist bureaucrats.\nLike other countries, Pakistan is navigating a crisis that will test its leadership.\nWhy urge these steps? To answer this, consider what has happened so far. First, on messaging, the early weeks saw mixed signals, which did not convey the urgency or severity of the unfolding threat. Public communication veered between saying this was little more than a flu virus that would afflict the elderly to asserting that the virus had not hit the country as hard as other nations. If the aim was to calm and not panic the public, the (unintended) result was to underplay the threat when people needed to be persuaded to stay home to prevent the virus from spreading.\nAs the number of cases rose, the prime minister’s tone changed. But procrastination over measures aimed at social distancing continued to send conflicting messages. Getting mired in a prolonged public argument about lockdown vs no lockdown conveyed an impression of indecisiveness.\nThat brings up the second step — act decisively. If, as government leaders claim, they first “reviewed” the looming threat in mid-January, how did they act on this? How was an under-resourced healthcare system enabled to deal with the remorseless onset of cases? Did “rapid, decisive action” follow after the first infection was confirmed on Feb 26?\nMissteps exacerbated the situation. Much has already been said about how zaireen (pilgrims) returning from Iran through the border crossing at Taftan were managed and cluster allowed into the mainland, which accelerated the spread of the virus. According to the latest official figures, over 30 per cent of current Covid-19 cases in Pakistan came via this route.\nThe centre’s unwillingness to move early to suspend air travel and restrict religious congregations had a similar deleterious effect, with scores of tableeghi members spreading the virus across Punjab and beyond. Official figures show almost 20pc of confirmed cases in the country today can be traced to the latter. Another 24pc have been tracked to people travelling back from countries other than Iran.\nThe federal government also did not take the lead on a lockdown, with officials debating its economic fallout rather than act. True, governments across the world struggled to find a balance between restrictive measures and economic activity. But as many international experts have pointed out, this is a false choice, because saving lives is necessary to save livelihoods. While the government’s economic packages and enhanced Ehsaas handouts are welcome steps to mitigate the economic fallout, the perpetual focus on this has fed the perception that the crisis is not being viewed through the prism of a public health emergency, but its economic repercussions.\nWhile the federal government vacillated, the Sindh government led the way and implemented a lockdown, obliging Punjab to follow suit. Its effective communication campaign also offered a contrast to the media strategy pursued by Islamabad.\nThe third step is centre-province coordination. This was found wanting weeks into the crisis. The prime minister’s reluctance to reach out and consult provincial leaderships, especially of Sindh, prevented a unified policy from emerging. Provinces went their own way until a National Coordination Committee and a Command and Operations Centre were established in mid-March and early April respectively. But provincial approaches — for example, on a lockdown — are still not harmonised. This prompted a Supreme Court judge to urge the centre during a recent hearing to improve coordination with provincial governments.\nFour, as the federal government mulls relaxing restrictions on economic activity, it remains important to meet clearly articulated health milestones, especially enhanced testing capability, before easing the lockdown. According to the government’s own projections, infections may reach 70,000 by end-April, as reportedly revealed to a cabinet meeting last week. If this projection is based on an assumption about a degree of compliance with social distancing, then that estimate can change if restrictions are relaxed early.\nLast but not least, the determination of when to ease restrictions should be made on the advice of health professionals. Their counsel should guide the overall policy response to Covid-19. They should be represented in the top policy bodies established to address the crisis, not just subsidiary committees. Membership of these bodies should be dictated by the nature of the crisis, not ministerial status. Expertise is needed to interpret the evolving response of the global medical community. This critical gap should be filled as the NDMA is designed to deal with natural disasters and other aspects of the ongoing crisis, not a health emergency.\nLike other countries, Pakistan has to navigate a crisis that will test its leadership. The prime minister has used the metaphor of war to describe the challenge of fighting Covid-19. He has a chance to emerge as an effective ‘wartime’ chief executive. Now is the time for him to live up to that challenge."}]}

But the reality that will continue to shape the post-pandemic world is this. While unprecedented global cooperation and a collective response will be needed to negotiate multiple challenges — threats to public health, economic recovery, food security, looming recession and unemployment — many countries will tend to turn inwards and act on their own. This paradox did not emerge during the pandemic. It has been evident in recent years but thrown into sharper relief by the Covid-19 crisis.\nThe world is in fact passing through one of history’s most unsettled periods with a number of trends reconfiguring the international landscape: retreat from multilateralism at a time of multipolarity, anti-globalisation sentiment, erosion of a rules-based international order, trade and technology wars between big powers and the rise of populist leaders who reject internationalism, pursue ultra-nationalist policies and act unilaterally.\nThis backdrop hardly prepared the world for what was to come when the deadly virus defied national boundaries and crossed continents in its remorseless spread. The ongoing crisis showed how interconnected and interdependent the world is and that no country can deal with the challenge on its own. But it also exposed the deep divisions between and within countries as they struggled to confront the havoc wrought by an unforgiving enemy.\nLogic and pragmatism dictated international cooperation. As UN Secretary General António Guterres put it: “To prevail against the pandemic today, we will need heightened solidarity.” But is this what we are witnessing? The short answer is, not really, because more disharmony than ‘solidarity’ has been on display.\nObviously, countries had, first and foremost, to focus on their own health emergency. But their effo­rts to contain Covid-19 would have benefited from collaboration on travel and trade restrictions, bord­­e­­­r closures and sharing of virus data and information.\nGeopolitics, not solidarity, holds sway.\nIt was the unseemly row that broke out during the pandemic between the two global powers, the US and China — who have the world’s most consequential relationship — that served to underline how geopolitics, not solidarity, remained the overarching reality.\nThe latest tussle came against the backdrop of intense trade and political tensions between the two countries. The trigger was President Donald Trump’s persistent description of the coronavirus as the ‘Chinese virus’, alluding to where the outbreak started, and criticism of China’s management of the outbreak. China’s retort was to cast such comments as racist and issue stern warnings while ‘unofficial’ Chinese sources purveyed conspiracy theories about who planted the virus. It took a phone call from Chinese President Xi Jinping to Trump, calling for cooperation, to calm down the situation.\nDespite China’s call for unity, this episode underlined the volatile relationship between the two economically interdependent but strategic competitors, who will nonetheless need each other’s cooperation to restart their economies and steer global recovery in the post-pandemic world. Unfortunately, though, China-bashing by American leaders has continued.\nThis, of course, isn’t the only development during the pandemic to illustrate the limits to ‘solidarity’ and how the world presents a spectacle where it is mostly every country for itself.\nExpectations that the G20 video summit in late March would produce a meaningful global response did not materialise. As several commentators have pointed out, this was very different from the decisive G20 action taken in response to the 2008 global financial crisis.\nEurope too hardly exhibited unity. The European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, acknowledged: “When Europe really needed an all-for-one spirit, too many initially gave an only-for-me response.” A former Danish prime minister put it starkly: The EU has “not passed the test of solidarity”. French President Emmanuel Macron warned of the EU’s collapse if it didn’t evolve a common response to stricken European economies.\nBy far, the most extraordinary development at the height of the pandemic was President Trump’s stinging attack on the World Health Organisation, the multilateral agency dealing with the coronavirus crisis, and his decision to suspend funding for it. He accused the agency of mismanaging the outbreak and being “China-centric”. Trump’s earlier criticism prompted the head of the global health body, Tedros Adhanom, to warn against politicising the virus to score political points.\nThe UN agency was arguably slow in declaring the Covid-19 outbreak a global health emergency and may not have moved as swiftly as the escalating crisis warranted.  But such gratuitous action by Trump at a critical moment was only the latest example of his contempt for multinational organisations, which have constantly been assailed by him.\nThe challenge to multilateralism and its institutions in recent years has not just come from Trump’s America but other nations and regional powers too, who have acted unilaterally in defiance of established international norms. Therefore, the wrangle between Trump and the WHO only shone another light on how multilateral institutions are under profound stress in the contemporary international milieu.\nA frustrated UN secretary general has had to frequently remind a fractured international community about the value of multilateral cooperation for the common good. In response to President Trump’s move against the WHO he again called for unity, describing Covid-19 as “one of the most dangerous challenges the world has faced in our lifetime”.\nDespite these entreaties before and during the pandemic, international cooperation has remained in short supply. Indeed, weakened commitment to multilateralism continues to be an unedifying feature of the global environment today. From the resurgence of geopolitical competition between the big powers, declining respect for global rules and go-it-alone strategies of populist leaders, who fan xenophobia for political gain, the picture that emerges is of an increasingly atomised international system.\nThis is not likely to change in the post-pandemic world. It is far from certain what kind of international order will evolve from the present Hobbesian-like melee. The US presidential election later this year will be critical for its global impact. Its outcome may not overturn the trends already in play but it could have a major influence on the future of a fraying multilateralism system. For now, the outlook is not promising even at a watershed moment when global cooperation is most needed for the imposing challenges that lie ahead."}]}

They seek a clear direction, reassurance, and above all, unity among public representatives so that they work together to responsibly and purposefully address the challenge. With the country faced with a national health emergency, the expectation is that politics will be cast aside and national purpose prioritised over politicking.\nWhat the public do not wish to see is bickering and politics as usual, with attacks on political opponents that serve as distractions from efforts to deal with the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. Nothing drains public trust more than partisan squabbling at a time of disruption and anxiety.\nThe political picture that has unfolded in the weeks since the virus struck is an unedifying one. Rather than a national policy and a collective response being evolved, the situation that emerged has been of provinces, especially Sindh, mostly going their own way and the centre taking uncertain charge of the crisis.\nThe onus to forge a national consensus rested with the federal government. But the opportunity was passed up despite offers for cooperation from the opposition. The stated justification was that there could be no truck with those who looted public money. In one fell swoop, the entire parliamentary membership was written off and the chance to evolve an inclusive policy squandered. The result was to divide, not unite, the country’s political forces.\nThe reluctance early in the crisis to frame a nationally agreed approach by consulting the provinces is explicable only in terms of politics — a partisan unwillingness to engage with opposition-led Sindh. That situation later improved once new policy bodies with provincial representation were set up but not nearly enough for a clear national narrative and policy to emerge. Arguments by prominent ruling party ministers that the 18th Amendment allowed provinces to choose their own path seemed a disingenuous effort to justify an abdication by the centre.\nNational purpose needs to be prioritised over politicking.\nMore troubling is the continuation of partisan attacks, mostly but not only, by ruling party members against their rivals. This was most strikingly exemplified by a bevy of ministers travelling to Karachi to hold press conferences and launch attacks on the Sindh government’s strategy. Irrespective of their disagreement with provincial actions, to engage in divisive politics at such a critical moment was more than just a diversion. It seemed an effort to undermine public trust in the provincial government when it was seeking public compliance for a lockdown in the country’s largest and most vulnerable city. Later, a prominent ruling party leader even accused the opposition of egging on doctors who addressed a press conference in Karachi only to urge the authorities to close venues where people could congregate. Meanwhile, daily tirades continue against the opposition by the federal government’s principal spokesperson.\nDeeper reasons and a checkered political past lie behind such unseemly conduct. The country does not have an inspiring record of political rivals working together. The 1990s, to cite an example, marked a decade of intense political confrontation and instability. Those at the receiving end of broadsides from ruling party members today behaved similarly against their foes in the past and are therefore hardly beyond reproach. Habits of tolerating the ‘other’ never took firm root in Pakistan’s fitful democracy. Locking up opposition leaders and slandering them has a long history. Polarised politics is therefore hardly new.\nHowever, in the post-2008 decade, a culture of political accommodation seemed to emerge. It was fragile and there were outbreaks of political feuding. But in a break from the past, there was greater tolerance of dissenting views. Adoption of the 18th Amendment, which following a prolonged period of consensus building, seemed to tentatively usher in the politics of conciliation and give and take.\nBut at the same time, the expansion of a freer broadcast media began to have a different impact. Political debate started to acquire a more shrill and harsh tone. Not unlike other democracies, television’s competitive 24/7 news cycle heightened the tendency for intensely partisan debate. An environment was fostered that accentuated stridency in the political discourse. Political protagonists felt that impact was created by outshouting an opponent on TV rather than engaging in calm discussion.\nThe rise of a new political force, now the ruling party, introduced its own brand of politics and campaigning. With its rejection of traditional politics and its political evolution taking place in agitational mode in an extremely combative environment, this also fostered a political culture of extreme partisanship. The party’s confrontational style of leadership helped to fire and mobilise a loyal body of supporters who wanted to break from the ‘old politics’. Its leaders convinced themselves that their uncompromising approach yielded rich political dividends. The self-image of a party challenging the political status quo led its members to consciously break norms, and use abrasive language, to distinguish themselves from their rivals.\nThe use of social media by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf — the first organised effort by any political party — produced its own effects. Social media became a powerful political tool but one that also contributed to aggressive messaging and politicking.\nAll of these seemed effective political tactics in opposition. But they persisted through the party’s assumption of power. As many analysts have pointed out, the PTI has yet to transition, in several important respects, from an opposition movement to a party of governance. Its attitude towards rival parties remains rejectionist as all are regarded as venal and opportunistic. While this depiction frees the ruling party from engaging the opposition, it has obvious consequences for governance in a polity that is federal, where the ruling party lacks a parliamentary majority on its own, minus its motley crew of allies, and in which its political rivals enjoy the allegiance of a sizeable section of the electorate.\nAn extraordinary crisis calls for extraordinary actions by the leadership. Regardless of the ruling party’s antipathy towards its opponents, a crisis of the magnitude of Covid-19 should urge its leaders to at least suspend their partisan conduct and divisive rhetoric for now and embrace an approach that is truly national in spirit and in practice. People expect nothing less from their political leaders."}]}

The simple answer is that the stalled process has little to do with the pandemic and everything to do with the clashing interests of Afghan parties and their inability to break the persisting deadlock on initiating an intra-Afghan dialogue.\nWhat the coronavirus outbreak has not done so far is to significantly affect the phased US withdrawal from Afghanistan. It may even be an additional incentive for Washington to stick to its drawdown plan irrespective of progress towards an intra-Afghan dialogue that can produce a negotiated end to the country’s long war. Indications are that the US drawdown from Afghanistan is proceeding as pledged in the US-Taliban agreement reached in Doha in February; American troops are supposed to reduce to 8,600 by this summer. Some reports suggest that some bases are already being cleared with US forces departing.\nMeanwhile, top American diplomats have continued to urge the Afghan parties — the government and the Taliban – to show flexibility to break the stalemate over the prisoner swap, the principal obstacle to starting intra-Afghan negotiations. Under the Doha agreement both sides had to release a specific number of detainees in their custody — 5,000 held by Kabul and 1,000 in Taliban custody. On the completion of this, an intra-Afghan process was to begin about eight weeks ago. This never happened.\nUS election year makes bringing troops home top priority.\nSo far around 550 prisoners have been released by the Afghan government and 112 by the Taliban. The rest of the exchange has come to a halt over disagreements about its terms. The Taliban say that the release of all detainees on their list is a pre-condition for intra-Afghan peace talks. They accuse Kabul of deliberate delay and demand the immediate release of detainees because of Covid-19.\nOn his part, President Ashraf Ghani insists on a reduction in violence before he frees more prisoners. He says he is willing to initially free only 1,500 but in a gradual way. This has been construed by many as a machination by Ghani to use the issue — his principal bargaining leverage at this point — to drag out the whole process. This view is reinforced by his efforts to also enlist certain regional powers who have little interest in seeing the Doha process succeed. One regional state is in fact seeking a parallel peace process. The Taliban have continued to argue that any ceasefire has to be a part and not a precursor to intra-Afghan negotiations.\nUS diplomatic efforts to overcome the impasse has seen engagement at the highest level by Washington. President Donald Trump’s recent phone call to the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s late March visit to Kabul all reflect these endeavours. So was a visit last month to Pakistan and the meeting with army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa by US special representative Zalmay Khalilzad and Gen Austin Miller, US and Nato forces commander in Afghanistan.\nWith violence on the uptick in Afghanistan, the aim of the parleys in Rawalpindi was to seek Pakistan’s help on different aspects of the peace process including a reduction of violence in line with Pakistan’s commitment to a political solution of the Afghan conflict. Intensification of fighting in Afghanistan and rejection by the Taliban of calls for a Ramazan ceasefire has sent worried American officials scurrying to try to prevent the Taliban’s stepped-up attacks on Afghan National Security Forces from further weakening them. The Taliban’s intensified attacks are aimed at mounting military pressure to strengthen their negotiating hand in intra-Afghan talks while hoping that this can precipitate the ANSF’s collapse or its ethnic fragmentation.\nThis strategy has been met by escalation in US-backed ANSF attacks on the Taliban. This has prompted accusations from the Taliban that the US, by attacking non-combat areas, is not abiding by the Feb 29 deal. A recently released UN report voices grave concern about the surge in violence in March and the consequent rise in civilian casualties.\nThe US diplomatic effort is now focused on persuading the Taliban to settle for the release of  2,000 prisoners (rather than 5,000) by Ghani, and not wait for the full swap so that intra-Afghan negotiations can begin. The aim has been for the process to start in early May. This seems an ambitious goal given the wide gap and opposing interests of the two Afghan parties. The dispute over the prisoner issue is more than just that. It reflects both sides’ unwillingness to concede anything significant to each other and portends the formidable difficulties that lie ahead even if this is resolved.\nAlthough the main impediment to the peace process is the impasse over the prisoner exchange, the tussle between President Ghani and Dr Abdullah Abdullah is also clouding prospects. US threats to suspend aid have been accompanied by attempts at reconciliation between the two rival claimants to the Afghan presidency. The EU has also warned of future funding being affected if the feud isn’t ended. Despite some encouraging signs, the two have yet to agree on a power-sharing plan to give Abdullah the executive position and authority he seeks, which Ghani has so far been reluctant to do.\nUS efforts to expedite the peace process are obviously driven by President Trump’s clear and oft-stated desire to end America’s long involvement in a war that has cost so much in blood and treasure. Being election year in the US, for him bringing troops home will be prioritised over trying to fix a troubled peace process if it doesn’t make any headway. Already there are credible news reports that Trump is getting more impatient and wants to speed up the drawdown.\nThe uncertain situation in Afghanistan poses severe dilemmas for Pakistan. While aiding the peace process in whatever way it can, Islamabad must envisage and be ready to deal with a range of scenarios that may emerge. It should also, in the interim, intensify its political and diplomatic outreach to all Afghan groups — a lesson that should be learnt from Pakistan’s history of troubled relations with Afghanistan."}]}

The calamity wreaked by Covid-19 has exposed political, economic and social weaknesses in many countries as well as fatal gaps in medical care. The coronavirus challenge stretched the capacity of governments around the world and made unprecedented demands on healthcare systems, but it also exposed underlying frailties that existed well before the outbreak.\nIn Pakistan, too, the pandemic has shone a spotlight on a number of fault lines. Four are important and should be addressed when the crisis is over. They are: the huge deficit in public healthcare in an otherwise expansive state apparatus; strained centre-province relations; the federal government’s inability to withstand pressure from a few clergy members on the Covid-19 response; and unstructured governance at the centre. Each has been consequential for handling the health emergency, but all have long been characteristics of the country’s political landscape.\nThe first fault line is the consequence of the lack of attention shown by successive governments to the social sector in general and the country’s grossly inadequate healthcare system in particular. Although most leaders paid lip service to increasing social sector spending, this never received the priority — and budget — needed to keep pace with the continual rise in the country’s population.\nHuman security — the security of people — often featured in official power point presentations, and still does. But it was never operationalised by framing policy and allocating resources. Nor were  efforts ever made to strike a balance between human and state security. Pakistan’s geopolitical location in a hostile neighbourhood imposed a heavy burden over the years, obliging the country to focus on and adequately resource defence to ensure state security. This was necessary. But it did not mean that commensurate attention should not have been given to peoples’ security — from disease, from illiteracy, from hunger. In education, for example, the private sector has sought to fill some of the yawning gap left by the state. To a lesser extent this has also been witnessed in the health sector with the growth of private medical facilities. But in the case of both, it is privileged sections of society who can access this, with the rest of the population excluded.\nThe pandemic highlights the need to address longstanding flaws.\nWhen the coronavirus disaster struck, it was no surprise that the country’s public healthcare facilities were found wanting. The subsequent effort mounted to deal with the calamity was nothing short of heroic by doctors and medical workers, with NDMA also acting efficiently in the critical area of medical equipment and logistics. But crisis management is fundamentally different from creating a sustainable basis to provide basic healthcare to citizens. This should prompt a reordering of priorities once the country has negotiated the ongoing crisis.\nThe second weakness the pandemic brought to the fore is the lack of a smooth working relationship between the centre and the Sindh government, despite protestations to the contrary by federal government spokesmen. Much has already been said about how this impeded implementation of a national response to Covid-19 and continues to hamper execution of a uniform policy to mitigate the spread of the virus. The 18th constitutional amendment has been held responsible for this by federal government ministers. This is misleading and little more than an effort to deflect attention from the centre’s disinclination to closely coordinate policy with the opposition-controlled Sindh government.\nCentre-province harmony has been rare in Pakistan’s history when rival parties have headed the federal government and provinces. Indeed, weak political will to work a federal system, inter-provincial tensions as well as lack of tolerance of the opposition are overlapping fault lines, which have hobbled the evolution of Pakistan’s democracy to one oriented to serving citizens rather than being preoccupied by political rivalries and power struggles.\nTroubled centre-province relations have had deleterious consequences for the country’s unity in the past. This needs no recall but the lesson it holds out should be remembered and, more importantly, acted on. Federalism involves reciprocal obligations between the centre and provinces and have to be practised not just held up as a constitutional precept. In the unfolding crisis, the likely price paid by sparring between the centre and Sindh government has been a rise in the number of virus cases that could well have been prevented.\nThe third fault line is the way the federal government succumbed to pressure from a few clerics on Ramazan congregations at places of worship. This, when almost all Muslim countries have closed mosques to save lives. Inviting some clergymen to the presidency and then conceding ground by accepting their demands signified a telling lack of will to ensure that they too abided by a lockdown imposed on everyone else. Entreaties from the medical community in this regard were ignored by Islamabad. The federal government didn’t just tread a well-worn path of the state caving in to a few clerics. It also ended up thwarting its own mitigation strategy. News reports testify that the voluntary guidelines agreed between the government and clerics are being widely violated. This is a reminder that when fear drives policy the government denudes itself of authority.\nLast but not least the pandemic has exposed the unstructured and personalised nature of decision-making at the federal level. The primacy of personality in policymaking has a long pedigree in Pakistan’s history but in the present crisis it exposes policy to a greater risk of erring. When personal predilection overrides decisions informed by expert advice and facts on the ground the risks are obvious. In this style of governance, new structures can be set up — as they have — to deal with the present crisis, but the policy approach they recommend is usually predetermined or shaped by the leader. This has contributed to a haphazard response to the crisis as strongly held personal views often seem to take precedence over well-considered, science-based assessments.\nNo fault line is ever cast in stone. They can be fixed or overcome. By exposing the more important ones in our country, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of dealing with them."}]}

The first was the spectacular lack of unity displayed in the specially requisitioned meetings of the National Assembly and Senate. And second was the lack of social discipline evidenced by crowded scenes in markets and bazaars across the country following an easing of the lockdown announced by the federal government.\nNeither came as a surprise but both are consequential to the management of the evolving health crisis. Far from peaking, this is now witnessing an alarming surge in numbers.\nExpectations that the first parliamentary session since the pandemic began would urge the government and opposition to demonstrate solidarity may have been misplaced given the bitter partisan bickering that preceded these meetings. But in the face of an unprecedented crisis it was still hoped that public representatives would temporarily set aside their politics and work together to address the issue for which the sessions were called: Covid-19.\nThis was not to be. The proceedings saw intense sparring and unseemly rhetoric by both treasury and opposition benches. But then it is the government’s responsibility to show leadership and take the initiative to reach out to the opposition and build consensus especially at times of crisis. In all democracies, oppositions oppose and subject the actions of the government to critical scrutiny. It remains the majority party’s obligation to extend a hand across the aisle to elicit cooperation from political opponents and mobilise support for its policies.\nComing weeks will be a defining time for the government.\nMost members of the patchwork PTI government are of course still new to parliamentary politics. But since the party’s assumption of power its leadership has shown little inclination to use parliament to forge consensus on key national issues, preferring to govern unilaterally. As a new political force, the PTI could have breathed new life and vigour into parliamentary proceedings. Instead parliament has principally been seen as a means to maintain the party in power rather than as an instrument of governance where opposition support is actively solicited, or as a forum used to shape or debate policy.\nThis attitude has carried over even at this time of crisis. As the majority party sets the tone and substance for parliamentary discussion, in last week’s proceedings it was the fierce partisan shots fired at the outset by treasury leaders which provoked a stronger response from the opposition than it may otherwise have intended. In other words, had government ministers adopted a conciliatory and less combative tone and called for political unity, unencumbered by gratuitous swipes at the Sindh government, it could have put the opposition on the defensive and injected a positive note into proceedings. But true to their party’s combative culture, front-bench leaders used provocative rhetoric which evoked an equally aggressive response.\nYet even in the midst of this fracas it was opposition leaders in Parliament, including Bilawal Bhutto, Khawaja Asif and Raja Zafarul Haq, who, notwithstanding their critique of the centre’s handling of the crisis, kept calling for unity in the face of the pandemic with offers of cooperation to fight the virus. This clarion call should have come in the first instance from government leaders. But in a role reversal it was left to the opposition to urge the need for political solidarity with front-line ruling party members later making television appearances to hurl more attacks at the opposition. This led to sharp opposition responses both in and out of parliament.\nAnother role reversal was evidenced when the federal government decided to soften the lockdown restrictions. The official announcement was accompanied by the declaration, subsequently reiterated, that with restrictions being eased, it was now up to people to exercise responsibility and abide by the standard operating procedures (SOPs) being laid out. This message meant that the government was not in a position to enforce its own guidelines; people and businesses had to do this themselves. In this role reversal, the buck of enforcement — the government’s responsibility — was passed to the public.\nIn countries where the Covid-19 crisis has been more effectively managed, easing of the lockdown has involved a combination of advice to the public by the authorities and administrative measures to ensure compliance with social distancing. But here the government seemed to virtually wash its hands off efforts to effectively implement its own SOPs.\nThe result could have been foreseen. Crowds flocked to bazaars and shops swarmed with people. Reading the lifting of restrictions from retail and other businesses as a signal for them to venture out too, people rushed with abandon to shops, many of which openly violated the SOPs. Most shoppers disregarded social distancing rules, hundreds of shops avoided prescribed precautions and the majority of mosques did not follow guidelines.\nThis is what the medical community had desperately warned the authorities about. That premature relaxation of restrictions, when the virus curve had not begun to flatten, was fraught with danger. A spike in cases would ensue from people abandoning social distancing. The Pakistan Medical Association urged the government to uphold the writ of the state and institute a proper lockdown, pointing out that restrictions were being eased in other countries only when virus cases were declining, which in Pakistan had yet to happen. That these warnings were warranted is now indicated by the continuing SOP breaches in public places and rising virus cases. It remains an open question whether the centre would be compelled to eventually impose stricter restrictions if this situation persists.\nThe consequences of the federal government’s policy have yet to fully unfold. What seems certain is that the coming weeks will be a defining time for the government. Having made light of the need for national unity in these testing times, the government has overlooked a key lesson from how other countries are addressing the pandemic. Leaders who have united their nation and adopted an inclusive approach have been the best performers, rather than those pursuing divisive policies. The government’s credibility now rests critically on how it deals with the crisis. Will its management be able to protect citizens’ lives or will it leave the country with the worst of both worlds — endangering both lives and livelihoods?"}]}

The pandemic has injected greater volatility into an international landscape already afflicted by threats to multilateralism, trade and technology wars between big powers and attempts by regional powers to reshape the rules of the game in their neighbourhood.\nUnderstanding the dynamics of a world in disarray where unilateral actions and rejection of international norms by big powers and populist leaders hold sway is important as they have implications for the pursuit of Pakistan’s foreign policy.\nFour key policy areas pose immediate challenges and have to be simultaneously addressed: 1) Navigating the US-China confrontation 2) Dealing with occupied Kashmir and managing relations with an implacably hostile India 3) Helping Afghanistan win the peace but also preparing for less hopeful scenarios 4) Balancing relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\nRising tensions between the US and China have a direct bearing on Pakistan. Even as Islamabad does not want this stand-off to affect its relations with either of the two countries, that is easier said than done. What has been described as a new cold war will intensify in a US election year when President Donald Trump has made China-bashing a central plank of his re-election campaign. He is both playing off a bipartisan political consensus and fortifying anti-China public sentiment that preceded the pandemic and has been strengthened by it.\nPakistan faces daunting foreign policy challenges in a turbulent environment.\nThe pandemic has also reinforced US plans to reduce economic dependence on China by reconfiguring or diversifying global supply chains and pursuing a more overt contain-China policy. When this gets underway it may result in India emerging as a stronger economic partner of Washington. This will also bolster the longer-standing American strategy to project India as a strategic counterweight to China especially as India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems willing to play that role.\nThe implications for Pakistan of the US-India entente are already evident by Washington’s tepid response on Kashmir and continuing augmentation of India’s military and strategic capabilities. Thus, closer US-India relations will confront Pakistan with a regional environment of greater strategic imbalance.\nConcern about CPEC and China’s Belt and Road Initiative has prompted frequent US criticism of these megaprojects. A White House report sent last month to Congress is more explicit, asserting that BRI will give China “undue political influence and military access”. Statements by American officials that CPEC will impose a heavy debt burden on Islamabad represent unsubtle though vain efforts to drive a wedge between Pakistan and China. While Islamabad will want to avoid getting in the cross hairs of US-China friction it is obvious that Pakistan’s strategic future lies with China. CPEC is emblematic of China’s aim to strengthen Pakistan, economically and strategically, and must be our overriding priority.\nPakistan’s relations with China remain on a positive trajectory but will need regular reinforcement. Close consultation with Beijing on key global and regional issues, including Afghanistan, will be important.\nTies with the US have improved, but lack substantive content. For now, the main commonality is Afghanistan. That too will be tested in coming months when hurdles are encountered in the fragile Afghan peace process. Nevertheless, it is important to keep engagement on a positive track while accepting the limits of the relationship.\nOn Afghanistan, Pakistan should extend whatever assistance it can to the much-delayed peace process, still facing a host of challenges. The recent Eid ceasefire between the Taliban and Kabul and the accord between President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah have however brightened prospects. What Pakistan’s establishment must come to terms with is President Trump’s intention to pull out US troops regardless of whether intra-Afghan talks advance or produce a negotiated end to the war. The latest indications of this are the US military withdrawal proceeding ahead of schedule and Trump’s reiteration that it was time for Afghans “to police their own country”. Washington’s stance is unlikely to change if Trump loses the November election to Joe Biden as they have similar views on disentangling the US from its costly involvement in Afghanistan.\nIslamabad thus needs to think long term and prepare for different scenarios that might emerge in Afghanistan keeping in view machinations by regional countries acting as spoilers in Afghanistan’s peace effort.\nPakistan’s most imposing challenge however will remain managing relations with India where the Modi government is bent upon crushing the Kashmiri resistance by unprecedented levels of repression and orchestrating anti-Muslim sentiment and pogroms in India. Dialogue with Delhi is ruled out by its brutal and illegal actions in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, where even medical services have been denied during the pandemic, and India’s refusal to discuss the issue. Aggressive moves by India on the Line of Control and covert actions in Balochistan represent a toxic mix that have sent tensions soaring with Pakistan. Prime Minister Imran Khan’s repeated warnings about a possible false flag Indian operation underlines the growing danger.\nFaced with this, Pakistan will have to avoid any engagement for the sake of engagement with India unless Pakistan’s concerns are accommodated in future talks. This is hard to see under Modi.\nOn Kashmir, Pakistan needs a strategic approach and a sustained diplomatic campaign — not an on-off approach. Tweets are not a diplomatic strategy. Noise is not a policy. A strategy for a changed global environment should preserve our principled stance while mobilising international support for a peaceful Kashmir settlement. This means pushing the boundaries at the international level. For a start, a virtual meeting of OIC foreign ministers should be sought, taking advantage of the rising concern among many OIC countries about India’s anti-Muslim actions. Once the situation permits, Pakistan should also seek a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council exclusively on occupied Kashmir to refocus world attention on the egregious human rights violations there.\nSpace limits detailed consideration of policy towards the Middle East. Most importantly, Pakistan should deftly balance its relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who remain locked in a tense stand-off, and stay the course on a policy that avoids being drawn into their rivalry, however challenging it may be given Pakistan’s increased financial reliance on Riyadh."}]}

In the past one month, coronavirus cases have seen a four-fold increase, with Pakistan overtaking China in Covid-19 infections. The number of fatalities has trebled in the past fortnight alone. Yet the government decided to follow a risky course and lift most restrictions while acknowledging at the same time that coronavirus cases will multiply.\nThe government’s distractions from managing the crisis also seem to be increasing by the day. It has been engaged in ad nauseam arguments over the sugar commission report, allegations of malfeasance against opposition leaders and, all the while, directing partisan attacks against the Sindh government.\nThis perhaps is unsurprising. From the outset, the government seemed to play down the gravity of the health emergency and kept sending mixed public messages. The various political fronts engaging the government’s attention also had the effect of shifting the public and media’s focus from the health crisis. Instead, it spawned a business-as-usual environment.\nThe government seems to have been guided in its response to the pandemic by several assumptions. One, that Pakistan was much better off than the world’s worst affected countries and that this situation would somehow be self-sustaining. By making the hardest-hit countries the frame of reference officials appeared to lull themselves — and the public — into a sense of complacency. Today Pakistan happens to be number 17 out of 188 countries in confirmed coronavirus cases. Pointing to the worse-off countries and not those doing better than Pakistan seemed disingenuous as it meant setting the lowest bar for crisis management. Assuming that the virus spread and severity would be far less in Pakistan than in the most impacted countries, the possibility of a delayed steep curve emerging was apparently discounted.\nThe government needs to learn from its mistakes, not repeat them.\nAnother assumption of the government seemed to be that so long as it assembled enough hospital beds and equipment the rest would take care of itself. Of course, enhancing medical facilities to cope with Covid-19 patients was necessary, and NDMA spearheaded an impressive effort. But it was not sufficient, as this needed to be part of a coherent and consistent strategy to contain the virus. That required an early intervention — not debate — to lockdown in order to stop the spread of infection and ensure public compliance with SOPs in the so-called smart lockdown phase. This turned out to be neither smart nor a lockdown. A responsible strategy warranted early implementation of a rigorously enforced national lockdown when the outbreak began and a gradual easing, calibrated with a sustained decline in virus cases. Timing was crucial as the experience of countries who effectively managed the crisis shows.\nBut the government’s pandemic response remained muddled while a robust nationwide health awareness campaign was conspicuous by its absence. Arcane televised briefings by officials were deemed sufficient to educate the public. Official claims about the number of ventilators acquired were never accompanied by necessary explanations about whether there were enough health personnel with expertise to operate these. Did officials think they were plug and play gadgets?\nMost importantly, the premise on which the government fashioned its response was to view the pandemic through an economic and not a public health prism. It certainly made sense for actions to ameliorate the economic damage from the crisis and help the most vulnerable, but the overriding priority had to be to save lives. Containing the virus was the surest way to mitigate the economic fallout and not the other way around. Latest research findings also suggest that stricter early lockdowns for a limited period are less damaging for the economy than lax but longer shutdowns.\nNot only did the government impose the initial lockdown half-heartedly but in prematurely reopening the economy — and tourism — it exposed the country to the risk of an exponential spread of the virus. This unfortunately is what is happening now. Justifying this by pointing to countries who also eased restrictions misses the point that most had done so when the virus curve was beginning to flatten, not rise, as the medical community has continued to insist here. But repeated warnings by doctors that new cases would multiply by slack government efforts to implement social distancing policy were cast aside in the name of saving the economy.\nThe ostensible official concern for the economic plight of the underprivileged overlooked the inescapable reality that they would be the most exposed to the virus by reopening business in the midst of the pandemic as they were not ensconced in socially distanced office spaces but clustered on factory floors or marketplaces.\nThen the various political distractions the government became mired in, reinforced the impression that its Covid-19 approach was to increasingly leave it to people to protect themselves. The public expectation of the government was that it would single-mindedly focus on the health crisis and leave politics for another day. But the opposite has been the case. Just when the virus began to surge more relentlessly the previous front-line role of health officials in the media seemed to recede — their voices drowned out by the shrill noise of certain federal government spokesmen who revelled in using insult as their favourite mode of political expression.\nAgain, this preoccupation with non-pandemic matters sent an unintended message to the public that the virus was no longer such a danger that needed the government’s undivided attention. This at a time when an increasing number of doctors and health workers were losing their lives to Covid-19 and the medical community was warning that the healthcare system could be overwhelmed if cases kept rising in the absence of decisive government intervention.\nWith the danger looming of a worsening health crisis the government needs to review its policy of loosening social distancing restrictions and take measures to ensure strict compliance with SOPs. This should not be haphazard as some panicky steps being taken now indicate. The government needs to learn from its mistakes, not repeat them."}]}

The pandemic has escalated tensions between them that were already at a record high before the Covid outbreak. This fraught situation has variously been described as a new Cold War, end of the post-1979 era, a geopolitical turning point and less seriously, a ‘scold war’.\nWhat does this mean for the world’s most consequential relationship? Is this a transformative moment from where ties will have to be completely redefined rather than reset? Will the two global powers arrive at a modus vivendi or will their stand-off become an enduring feature of the international landscape? How much of China-bashing in the US reflects campaign politics in an election year? Is the friction an inevitable result of a global power’s response to the rise of another that can challenge its predominant position — a classic phenomenon witnessed throughout history when power dynamics shift fundamentally?\nIs economic decoupling between the two inescapable? Or will present hostilities eventually give way to a restructuring of ties in which relations may end up being fiercely competitive and selectively cooperative but with overtones of hostility?\nClearer answers will emerge over time. But a key factor that could shape future relations will be the US presidential election in November when the next occupant of the White House will have to decide how to manage relations with China: to stabilise the relationship on new terms, or embark on a course of drawn-out confrontation. In both eventualities, a return to engagement that previously characterised relations with China is unlikely.\nThe future course of Sino-US ties will have far-reaching consequences for the world.\nThis is because the political consensus and public opinion that has emerged in the US — fanned by President Donald Trump’s actions and rhetoric — sees China as an adversary that has exploited the US on trade and poses a strategic challenge that needs to be countered and contained, not engaged. Many foreign policy advisers of the Democratic contender for the presidency, Joe Biden, also happen to be hawks on China. Therefore, whoever wins the election will likely follow a tough line on China.\nBeijing’s interest lies in de-escalating tensions and steadying relations. But it is up against the weight of US-led Western opinion that has become increasingly sceptical and hostile towards China. The European Union which has strong economic equities in ties with China is being assiduously courted by Beijing to encourage it to follow an independent path from Washington. But developments in Hong Kong have added to European suspicions of China.\nIn the face of Trump’s provocative statements and actions during the pandemic, China has generally kept its cool, reacting sharply only when Washington crossed certain red lines or when Trump’s patently misleading narrative needed to be countered. But top US officials led by Trump have continued virulent criticism of China. This provoked China’s foreign minister Wang Yi to warn that the US was pushing China to the brink of a new Cold War. But he also stressed that both countries had a major responsibility for “world peace and development”, and that “China and the US stand to gain from cooperation, and lose from confrontation”.\nThere are limits though to China’s forbearance in the face of offensive US actions. There is fresh thinking in Beijing about how to deal with a more antagonistic Washington and growing nationalist sentiment that their country should push back against Western criticism and US bullying. This sentiment is already driving a more assertive Chinese policy in Asia.\nChina is expected to emerge as the world’s largest economy in a decade. This should itself persuade the US and its Western allies that engagement is necessary in their own interest with a country that will be pivotal to achieving post-pandemic global economic revival and addressing a host of other international challenges. However, this rational calculation and also the fact that China remains Washington’s biggest lender may not be enough to overcome US apprehensions about the challenge posed to America’s global position by China’s rise.\nA report titled United States Strategic Approach to the People’s Republic of China, submitted by the White House to Congress last month, lays bare these wide-ranging concerns. It says that US National Security Strategy demands that Washington “rethink the failed policies of the past two decades — policies based on the assumption that engagement with rivals and their inclusion in international institutions and global commerce would turn them into benign actors and trustworthy partners”. The future approach should be based on “tolerance of greater bilateral friction”.\nThe report says that America is in strategic competition with China and enumerates the economic and security challenges posed by Beijing. The tone is of a power anxious to counter a strategic challenger whose economic strength and reach have already eroded America’s global pre-eminence. More explicitly, US Defence Secretary Mark Asper declared in February that China is top of the Pentagon’s list of potential adversaries.\nIn one of the most influential books on Sino-US relations published in 2017, Harvard scholar Graham Allison invoked the ancient Greek historian Thucydides’ depiction of the dangerous trap that emerges when one great power challenges or is poised to displace another. The historian had pointed to the inevitability of war when the fear of the rise of another power determined the established power’s actions. Allison recalled that in 12 of 16 cases in history this dynamic between the two led to conflict.\nThe need to avoid the Thucydides’ Trap has not only been Allison’s advice but that of several thinkers and policymakers, most notably Henry Kissinger. Allison often quotes Kissinger as saying, “The Thucydides’ Trap is the best lens for looking through the noise and news of the day to the underlying dynamic driving the relationship between the US and China.” Kissinger has also frequently warned of the devastating consequences of falling into this trap and urged the need to place relations on a stable and peaceful course.\nThe key question is whether the present era’s most significant bilateral relationship will be managed responsibly to avert a complete breakdown, even conflict. After all the future course of Sino-US relations will be a game changer for the world, with far-reaching consequences for the global economy and international peace and security."}]}

The sweep of the country’s foreign policy over the decades also reveals a complex interplay between internal and external factors, and between domestic goals and an ever-changing international environment.\nOf course, big power interests in the region had a major impact on policy, intersecting with elite interests to sometimes complicate if not aggravate Pakistan’s challenges. An unedifying aspect of this was a mindset of dependence fostered among officials during prolonged periods of the country’s alignments. This dependence proved to be habit forming. Reliance on external financial assistance — as a consequence of these alignments — created a perverse incentive for urgent economic reform and serious domestic resource mobilisation. It also encouraged ruling elites to constantly look outside to address financial deficits and other sources of internal vulnerabilities, even see outsiders as catalytic agents to promote development and solve problems at home.\nAbdul Sattar’s book Pakistan’s Foreign Policy 1947-2019, whose fifth edition has been published this year, does not examine this linkage between the internal and external and how they have been intertwined in such a consequential way. But it offers a useful beginner’s guide to the many twists and turns of foreign policy. Meant primarily for students of international relations, it remains a valuable starting point for anyone interested in learning — in concise form — about the factors driving Pakistan’s external engagements since the country’s inception.\nSattar witnessed first-hand many of the watershed developments in foreign relations during his 39-year career in the foreign service. As foreign secretary he was a participant in several key policy decisions. I had the privilege of working briefly with him in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 when I served as Pakistan’s ambassador to the US and he became foreign minister. I found him anxious to listen to the assessment and advice of the mission — rarely done now — and eager to share his perspectives with our team. His visits to Washington at a challenging time were marked by candid conversations with our interlocuters, often punctuated by a dry wit. He passed away last year, a month after he finished updating his book.\nPakistan came to rely on itself for defence but financial dependence remains a habit.\nThe central theme of his book is summed up in the foreword by a towering figure in Pakistani diplomacy, Agha Shahi. The “tyranny of power disparity” in the region was brought painfully home when the country was unable by its efforts and those of the UN to achieve the settlement of disputes after independence. To address this situation, Shahi writes, Pakistan “began to look outward for friends and allies” to “safeguard its independence, strengthen security and build the economic sinews of the infant state”. The need to address this power asymmetry tyranny drove Pakistan into alliances during the Cold War and beyond.\nThis led, until the Cold War ended, to a prolonged pursuit of a strategy of external balancing though Sattar does not use this expression to describe Pakistan’s search for alliances. The cost of alignment with Washington was high, he asserts, and second thoughts arose on the wisdom of this policy, but Pakistan couldn’t afford to abandon this course aimed as it was to “contain the Indian threat in which the US had little interest”. But in those early Cold War years, Pakistan, by abjuring a non-aligned policy, lost the support of influential Arab nations and found itself isolated among African-Asian countries.\nMeanwhile, Pakistan sought to engage the US, when it became America’s most allied ally, in efforts to promote a settlement of Kashmir. These attempts were blocked by an intransigent India and its Cold War ally. In 1962, when the Security Council took up the Kashmir issue, India’s foreign minister Krishna Menon reneged on New Delhi’s commitment to hold a plebiscite. The US president then persuaded his Irish counterpart whose country held the Council presidency to sponsor a resolution recalling past resolutions that called for a plebiscite. Despite support from seven members the resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union.\nIn reviewing the history of Pakistan’s foreign engagements Sattar identifies a number of turning points. The first was alliance with Washington and turning away from non-alignment, “dictated by the necessity of containing the tyranny of power-disparity”. The second was the growing strategic relationship with China and end of the alliance with the US when it failed to help Pakistan in the 1965 war. The third was the post-1965 turning to the East and distancing from the West. The next turning point came with the 1971 debacle and the lesson Pakistan drew, which dictated the pursuit of the nuclear option. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 marked another turning point which led to Pakistan’s long involvement as well as resumption of the alliance with Washington. This ended with the Soviet exit from Afghanistan. Then came the turning point after 9/11 when Pakistan “was dragged into partnership in the war on terror”, which Sattar argues “brought more problems than benefits”.\nThe most recent turning point that Sattar did not live to write about has seen Pakistan tie its strategic future more firmly to China while facing an implacably hostile India that has sought to illegally change the status quo in occupied Kashmir. In fact, the country’s daunting foreign policy challenges in the present phase call for a more imaginative strategy to navigate a more complex and unsettled multipolar world.\nThe world has changed fundamentally but habits ingrained over the years by the ruling elite have yet to do so. Pakistan learnt to rely on itself for its defence when it pursued and acquired the strategic capability to deter aggression. But the habit persists of seeking help from foreign donors to deal with chronic financing gaps — frequently dramatised by frantic trips to Arab capitals. A similar lesson has yet to be learnt about financial self-reliance which is only possible through bold fiscal reform and a reordering of budget priorities. The tyranny of dependence waits to be overcome."}]}

But not before alast-minute effortby Prime Minister Imran Khan to fete his party’s parliamentarians and coalition partners in order to calm growing restiveness in their ranks.\nAn evening on the lawns of Prime Minister House does not, however, represent a political strategy. Nor will the government’s problems both within its party and with allies vanish with the passage of the budget or the prime minister’s presence in the National Assembly twice last week. If anything, the budget session has shown that a united and resolute opposition is intent on mounting more pressure on the government at a time when the public impression gaining ground is of a government underperforming in the face of multiple challenges including those generated by Covid-19. More significantly, growing dissent and infighting in the ruling party indicates that managing the party is also becoming a daunting problem at a critical moment.\nOf course, some dissension and disgruntlement can be expected in any political party and is far from unusual. But when thisfrequently surfacesin public, and prominent ministers and MNAs air dissenting views on television, it acquires political significance. When such openly expressed misgivings coincide with or are encouraged by the public perception of faltering governance it becomes even more consequential.\nWhat do we make of all of this? What does it reveal about the ruling party? About its leader’s style of political management? And about his ability to deal with discontent within its ranks and among unhappy coalition partners?\nAlienating allies and leaving party tensions unresolved signals trouble ahead.\nThe most obvious aspect of the PTI government, which has attracted frequent comment, is the inherent tension between elected members and an army of unelected advisers and special assistants. This kind of friction afflicted previous ruling parties too. But the PTI government has earned the distinction of appointing a record number of advisers and special assistants — the largest in recent history. This has triggered increasing resentment among its lawmakers. Their lack of access to the top and to development funds also lies behind their disenchantment. Many lawmakers feel they were used by the leadership to secure power and then ignored. These tensions have been left to fester by a leadership that does not seem to regard this as a problem, except when votes are needed for parliamentary motions. Such an ad hoc approach does little to resolve underlying issues.\nThis is especially the case when dealing with allies in what is a coalition government. Allies are needed to sustain the government’s majority in the National Assembly. But the inability to accommodate the interests of coalition partners has already led to a parting of the ways with the BNP-M, whose leader Akhtar Mengal cited the government’s failure to deliver on its promises as the reason for the rupture. Another ally, the PML-Q, was conspicuous by its absence from the prime ministerial dinner, sig­­nalling its displeasure over unfulfilled commitments.\nOne factor behind this increasing discontent is the leadership’s attitude towards parliament. The prime minister himself has shown little interest much less patience in working parliament. Showing up occasionally to deliver rambling lectures is not enough. Parliamentary politics is quintessentially participatory. It requires building consensus, listening to opposing views, accommodating dissenting voices and regularly meeting party backbenchers to respond to their demands and solicit support for policy. By rejecting ‘traditional politics’, the ruling party has, in similar vein, also devalued parliament’s role except when frontbenchers use it to hurl invective against the opposition.\nBut there is another, more significant factor that may have become a disincentive for the leadership to engage with parliamentary members. When the need has arisen for support from allies and its own MNAs, the civil-military establishment has aided the government in mobilising that support. Reliance on non-political actors has obviated the need to take parliament seriously and engage regularly with its members. Moreover, as the coalition itself was cobbled together in no small measure by the establishment’s help, party leaders again tend to look to it to keep allies in line.\nAs for the party’s internal rifts, they reflect the fact that the PTI comprises diverse interests and represents a motley crew of original supporters, defectors from other parties and new entrants recruited at the time of election with establishment support. Many who joined the party in Punjab were former PML-Q and PPP members while in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, assorted defectors were from the Jamaat-i-Islami, PPP and PML-N.\nInfusing this heterogeneous membership with unity of purpose has not been easy and explains why the ruling party has lurched between contradictory positions. That is also why the party still defines itself by what it is against rather than what it stands for. It is ‘against corruption’, ‘against traditional politicians’ and against business ‘mafias’. Thus, it has yet to create a positive identity for itself.\nManaging the party in power presented a bigger challenge especially as it was loosely organised — more like a fan club than an organised party. For a long time, responsibility for party management was given to Jahangir Tareen, a seasoned politician. This worked well until he fell out of favour with Khan. No one was subsequently delegated the task, which has left the party in disarray with discordant voices on the rise.\nWhat remains an enigma is the party leader’s unwillingness to control infighting especially among its senior members. A deliberate let-them-fight strategy aimed at keeping senior leaders off balance could be an explanation. But a more plausible one is that he appears averse to stepping down from his pedestal to ‘sully his hands’ in resolving factional political disputes. Whatever the reason, it leaves the party in a disorderly state and creates an impression of a leader distanced from party affairs. It also frees ministers to say and tweet what they wish, at times contrary to official policy, reinforcing the public perception of a disorganised team running the government.\nOf course, none of this poses an existential threat to the government. But alienating allies and leaving party tensions unresolved signals trouble ahead in what promises to be a long and politically hot summer."}]}

Recent visits to Kabul, Islamabad and Doha by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and a video conversation between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Taliban chief negotiator Abdul Ghani Baradar last month all aimed at speeding up the peace process.\nPresident Donald Trump seems determined to pull out the bulk of US troops from Afghanistan ahead of the November polls and portray this as fulfilment of his pledge and an ‘achievement’, especially when he has little to claim by way of any foreign policy success. The withdrawal of US forces as envisaged under the Feb 29 US-Taliban agreement is proceeding ahead of schedule. The coronavirus pandemic may be a compelling reason to expedite the pullout.\nThe prospect of commencing intra-Afghan talks is still clouded in uncertainty despite the US aim to have them convened later this month. The principal hurdle is the persisting stalemate on the issue of prisoners. Under the Doha deal the Afghan government was committed to release up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners. So far just over 4,400 prisoners have been freed by Kabul and around 660 by the Taliban in the swap. From the outset the Taliban’s condition to begin intra-Afghan talks was the release of all 5,000 prisoners. US officials have tried to persuade them to start the talks and let the rest of the prisoner release happen in due course. But the Taliban have not agreed.\nA long and difficult path lies ahead to secure a negotiated end to the war.\nMeanwhile, President Ashraf Ghani has continued to drag his feet on releasing the prisoners arguing that many of them are dangerous militants or guilty of serious human rights abuses. The Taliban regard this as just a pretext to delay the talks. It is entirely possible that Kabul is prevaricating  as this may be the last source of leverage that President Ghani enjoys ahead of the talks, which he is reluctant to give up at this point. Instead, he has offered different proposals on the issue but the Taliban have rejected any piecemeal prisoner release. This remains the main impediment in the process that was expected to begin in March, days after the Doha agreement, but it continues to hang in the balance.\nThe uptick in violence in Afghanistan is also vitiating the atmosphere for dialogue. It is, however, not unusual for combatant parties in such a situation to sustain or escalate attacks to strengthen their negotiating position ahead of talks. Reduction of violence and a “permanent and comprehensive ceasefire” are a top agenda item in intra-Afghan negotiations according to part four of the Doha Agreement. It is, therefore, unlikely that before formal negotiations begin either of the two parties will refrain from mounting military pressure on the other.\nNevertheless, any spectacular attack could set back peace efforts. Pompeo’s tweet after his conversation with Mullah Baradar, which said that he warned him against attacks on American personnel, reflected Washington’s concern for its troops’ security but it also fuelled the impression that there is implicit acceptance that some fighting between Afghan forces and the Taliban will continue despite US calls for a reduction in violence.\nIf the impasse over the prisoners issue is overcome the Taliban are committed to joining intra-Afghan talks soon after. Agreement will then have to be forged on issues such as venue and who will be the mediator for the talks at least in the beginning. The inaugural meeting to kick off the talks is expected to be in Doha, but thereafter there are several proposals on where subsequent rounds could be. They include Doha or shifting to Oslo, Germany or Uzbekistan. Ghani has also proposed that each subsequent round should be held in a different location.\nOnce talks begin, the US would be obliged under the Doha Agreement to begin an administrative review of sanctions and the rewards list against members of the Taliban. It is also committed to start consultations with other UN Security Council members to delist Taliban members from the Council’s sanctions list.\nOf course, the thorniest issues lie ahead in complex intra-Afghan negotiations once they are launched. Achieving a lasting ceasefire by agreeing on its scope and terms and setting up a mechanism for its enforcement will pose a major challenge. How  “joint implementation mechanisms” mentioned in the Doha deal would be evolved seems particularly problematic. For example, would this mean that areas under Taliban control would be ‘legally’ accepted by Kabul when such an arrangement is implemented?\nAn even more formidable challenge in direct talks will be to reach agreement on a political settlement. The joint declaration between the US and Afghan government, announced along with the Doha Agreement in February, envisages a ‘framework agreement’ to emerge from intra-Afghan talks. This would involve settling contentious issues of provisional power sharing, constitution and human rights, and equally vexed matters relating to demobilisation of Taliban forces and their reintegration. In recent virtual meetings with regional and international partners, President Ghani has sought support for his position that the end state should be a republic in an effort to pre-empt the Taliban’s expected demand for Afghanistan to be declared a Sharia state or emirate.\nThen there is the question of whether an interim government would be needed to transition to the ‘new post-settlement Afghan Islamic government’, which is ambiguously mentioned in the Doha accord and is to be determined by the intra-Afghan dialogue. President Ghani has repeatedly ruled out any interim or provisional government arguing that this is contrary to the constitution. But the question is whether the Taliban will accept power sharing without a new political arrangement first being installed.\nA long and difficult path lies ahead to secure a negotiated end to the Afghan war. What seems certain is President Trump’s intent to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan regardless of whether the intra-Afghan talks make progress or yield an outcome. Indications that he may want a speedier withdrawal if talks are just initiated suggests that the intra-Afghan dialogue is seen as Washington’s exit door out of Afghanistan. The implications of this for Pakistan should not be lost on Islamabad."}]}

While the jury is still out on how countries have fared, there is considerable evidence now of what it takes to manage competently. Countries with leaders who governed well before the crisis, and were decisive, inclusive and listened to their experts after the outbreak, did much better to contain the virus than whimsical leaders who made policy a hostage to their ego.\nThe question has also been raised of whether democracies or authoritarian states have managed the crisis better. Illiberal democracies have been identified as among those who have mishandled the response. Gender as a factor in leadership has also been considered with analysts pointing out that many women leaders have outperformed several of their male counterparts. The examples cited are of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nMore important than the type of political system or gender is the quality of governance that preceded the pandemic and was tested, as was the leadership, when Covid-19 struck. Able management has been possible under different political systems. But democracies with poor leadership have had no edge over other political systems.\nPicking daily fights with opponents distracts from challenges and sets up a divisive form of governance.\nExamples abound. Perhaps the US provides the most compelling illustration of how a country under an erratic leader governing divisively and capriciously made such a mess of its pandemic response. There is consensus among Western opinion makers that President Trump’s inept handling has exacerbated America’s health crisis. Writing in theFinancial Times, Martin Wolf argued that the “President and administration neither want to govern nor know how to do so”. Trump became the “embodiment of fierce internal divisions” that played a destructive role during the crisis. David Remnick wrote inThe New Yorkerthat Trump’s stumbling response was no surprise given that even before, his administration was “more interested in setting fires than in investing in fire prevention or containment” — dismantling the “administrative state”, abandoning international agreements and cutting spending on science, health and emergency preparedness. Moreover “expertise offended Trump”.\nOther leaders who governed by whim not wisdom or consultation also fumbled badly in the pandemic. These cases confirm a basic fact — that ruling and governing are fundamentally different. Securing the country’s top political office is one thing, but knowing what to do and acting in the public interest quite another.\nSo, what distinguishes governance from simply ruling a country? What makes for good governance? There are several, often interrelated principles which are generally accepted as contributing to effective governance. Of these four are noteworthy.\nThe first is having a national vision and a clear road map to govern in the public interest. This entails crafting a national — not polarising — narrative to inspire confidence and elicit public support. Its antithesis is a reactive approach, which lets events drive policy and responds only after a crisis has erupted.\nA second principle is inclusive governance, which brings people together and unites the nation behind a chosen policy course. This involves governing by consensus and reaching out to political opponents to build trust — the key to securing compliance from citizens and political actors. It also means shunning partisan politics to achieve national goals.\nThe third principle is an institutional, not personalised, approach to decision-making and ensuring that any impulsive instincts of a leader are kept in check by laid down processes. Structured governance is predictable and orderly, which by following established procedures enables advice to be systemically received and factored into decision making.\nGood governance is, above all, competent government. The fourth principle to achieve this is to seek sound solutions to problems, not bemoan the past and the legacy of challenges a government has inherited. This means a focus on problem solving for the future, not living in the past. It involves valuing expertise in decision-making and listening to others.\nHow does Pakistan’s current leadership size up against these principles?\nAs much has already been said about its haphazard response to Covid-19, it is instructive to evaluate its general approach to governance that preceded the pandemic and was subsequently reinforced. From the outset the federal leadership rejected an inclusive approach, preferring to rule unilaterally in excessive partisan fashion, dubbing all non-supporters as unworthy of engagement. This meant losing an opportunity in the ongoing health crisis to unify the country and forge a national strategy by political consent. The government still prefers to only represent its own party supporters rather than the entire country.\nIts polarising conduct is demonstrated by its ministers and spokesmen picking daily fights with opponents and so-called mafias. This not only distracts attention from ongoing challenges but also sets up a divisive form of governance. These distractions have meant that as problems have emerged — ranging from shortages of flour, petrol and energy — the government has been behind rather than ahead of the curve in tackling them.\nThe most stunning example of its missteps has been the irresponsible handling of the PIA pilots affair. Addressing the licence issue did not have to involve destroying the national carrier’s credibility and tarnishing the country’s reputation.\nThe government’s penchant to constantly blame others for every problem has actually hobbled its problem-solving efforts. Ceaseless references to the conduct of previous governments has mired ruling party leaders in battling the past rather than fixing their minds on the future.\nThe cult of personality that characterises the government has contributed to the lack of institutional governance while the leader’s dominance has encouraged group think and denuded his government from receiving alternate, expert policy advice. Personalised governance devalues processes through which expert advice is relayed. Despite the bevy of advisers appointed by the prime minister the paradox is how little premium is put on their advice.\nIn view of this it is not surprising that the image that persists of the government is that it is an amateurish team that endlessly congratulates itself for its competence but has a great deal of ground to cover before the public sees it the same way."}]}

Will it mean more of the same or usher in changes in American foreign policy? Will it bring an end to the disruptive effect that the Trumpian approach has had at an unsettled time in international affairs?\nWith elections just over three months away, Democratic contender Joe Biden has a two-digit lead over President Donald Trump whose approval ratings have plummeted due to his mishandling of the pandemic and a weakening economy. This lead will likely narrow as the campaign advances with the race expected to be close. An unusual election in the midst of the continuing pandemic means greater unpredictability especially in view of Trump’s efforts to set the stage to challenge and delegitimise the outcome if he loses.\nAlso read:Biden vs Trump — US general election battle is now set\nIt would be instructive to consider how different the foreign policy approaches of the two contenders will be, based on what they have said or done so far. Foreign policy cannot of course be divorced from the domestic situation. If foreign policy is a reflection of the internal strength and cohesion of a country, the US is no exception to this. Trump’s divisive and combative leadership and his controversial policies on race and policing have left his country in a state of disarray, division and dysfunction. This has damaged America’s reputation and global standing and eroded its soft power — weaknesses that will be reinforced if Trump is re-elected. A Biden presidency will seek to heal these internal divisions and try to reverse its deleterious fallout on America’s global image. That would represent the first fundamental difference between them.\nTheir general approach to foreign policy will also be appreciably different. Biden’s will be more conventional and predictable in sharp contrast to Trump’s whimsical and disruptive handling of global affairs, which will remain his style of conducting foreign relations if re-elected. Indeed, Trump’s blustering posture always exceeded the power his country could mobilise to secure compliance from other nations. It didn’t take long for targeted countries to figure this out and push back effectively against such perceived bullying. Cases in point are North Korea and China.\nWill the election outcome mean more of the same or bring policy change?\nTrump can be expected to continue his ‘America First’ unilateral policy, rejecting multilateralism, abandoning more international organisations or agreements, showing disdain for traditional alliances including Nato and disregarding allies on key fronts. Biden, on the other hand, has long dealt with foreign policy and defines himself as a “liberal internationalist”. He will seek to revive America’s multilateral credentials, rejoin global bodies, restore partnerships in Europe and Asia, repair ties with allies and strengthen Nato, as a longtime supporter of the alliance. In a recent interview, Biden’s top foreign policy adviser, Tony Blinken, reiterated this faith in the principles of liberal internationalism.\nRead:How America was Trumped\nOn the Iran nuclear deal, a Biden administration is expected to rejoin it and seek to “improve” it. Biden regarded Trump’s 2018 abandonment of the agreement as disastrous, which left the US “much worse off”. He has repeatedly declared he would re-enter JCPOA if Iran abided by it and then work to strengthen it with partners. He has also said that “Doing so would provide a critical down payment to re-establish US credibility, signalling to the world that America’s word and international commitments once again mean something”.\nOn the world’s most critical bilateral relationship — between the US and China — a re-elected Trump would likely continue on a course of confrontation making future ties turbulent and marked by more provocative actions. He will try to refashion the trade equation between the two global powers but in the face of a more confident and assertive China. The anti-China mood in the US will be reinforced during the campaign as both candidates portray themselves as tough on China. The two camps are already accusing each other of being soft on Beijing.\nAs the popular and political consensus in America now sees China as a manipulative adversary, this will also shape Biden’s policy approach. Most of his foreign policy advisers are hawks on China. Nevertheless, while adopting a tough stance towards Beijing and engaging in strategic competition as well as containment, Biden may be less combative than Trump and seek areas of cooperation such as climate change and North Korea. He may also try to revive the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nOn Afghanistan, Trump has made plain his intention to withdraw all US military forces as committed under the Doha agreement between the US and Taliban. While his administration is making efforts to start intra-Afghan talks that can negotiate an end to the war, he is set on an American exit from Afghanistan regardless of whether a political settlement is reached. Biden is unlikely to shift course on this. He has long been engaged on the Afghan issue and understands regional dynamics well. As vice president, he opposed president Barack Obama’s military surge in 2009 and argued instead for a narrower counterterrorism mission. Bob Woodward’s book Obama’s Wars provides detailed insights into Biden’s thinking at the time and his views on both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Asked this February what he would do on Afghanistan he said he would bring American troops home during his first term. It is unclear how he might act if he listens to those in the US establishment who warn that a swift withdrawal could bring chaos.\nSouth Asia is not expected to be a high priority for either of the two contenders but both are likely to strengthen ties with India to balance China. A Biden administration would however recognise problems in the relationship because of India’s increasing authoritarianism and not shy away from speaking on human rights. This is already reflected in his campaign platform which stated last month that Biden understands the pain Muslim-Americans feel on issues including Kashmir. It also called on India to “take all necessary steps to restore rights for all the people of Kashmir”.\nBiden, who has visited Pakistan several times, is expected to be favourably disposed to engagement with Islamabad and in a more predictable way than Trump. Much will also depend on how proactive and imaginative Islamabad is in engaging his administration. A detailed assessment will follow in a later column."}]}

This will offer an insight into big power dynamics at the multilateral level and also help to draw lessons from a key meeting in Kashmir’s diplomatic history.\nIndia’s actions in occupied Kashmir had created a dangerous situation in violation of UNSC resolutions, obliging Pakistan to take the issue to the world’s highest diplomatic forum — the Security Council. It was an arduous path to a meeting, which should have been called without a hitch, as Kashmir remains among the oldest items on the UNSC agenda. What made it especially challenging was that Pakistan was not a member of the Council.\nThen there was the challenge posed by what for over 72 years has prevented implementation of UNSC resolutions on Kashmir: big power interests reflected in the positions of the Council’s five permanent members (P5). For example, after India reneged on its pledge to hold a plebiscite, the Soviet Union acted as the prime protector of India’s interests on Kashmir, even exercising the veto. Over time, other P5 members acted similarly at different points.\nA setback for India, the Security Council meeting reaffirmed the Kashmir dispute’s international status.\nThe P5 were therefore the key to ensuring that the UNSC discussed the issue after the Indian action. As Pakistan’s ambassador to the UN at the time, I faced one of the most challenging moments of my diplomatic career, as did the Pakistan Mission team. On receiving instructions from the government that a meeting must be called our first consultations were with the Chinese Mission. As a permanent member, it was China who would make the request to the Council president and weigh in with other members.\nIt was clear that Pakistan and China had to work in close tandem to overcome the opposition India would mount. A frenetic round of meetings followed in New York while our foreign minister dashed to Beijing and spoke to counterparts from all Security Council members. The foreign ministry too repeatedly reached out to UNSC member states. During these crucial days, Prime Minister Imran Khan kept in close touch with me to track progress and make suggestions.\nWhat proved extremely helpful was the stand the secretary general had taken earlier. Hours after India’s Aug 5 action, I approached his office to stress the need for a public statement to underline the criticality of addressing the situation. Guterres was away, but I met his chief of staff on Aug 7 to convey the urgency for a swift public position and linked this to his ‘Conflict Prevention’ agenda. The secretary general’s statement came on Aug 9. He said the UN position on the decades-old dispute was governed by the UN Charter and “applicable Security Council resolutions”.\nThis timely reiteration helped to frame the issue for UNSC members and persuade some of them of the need for a meeting. As Islamabad launched vigorous efforts in their capitals, I met repeatedly with representatives of all 15 Council members. Meetings followed with the UN’s department of political affairs. We agreed with China that the proposed meeting start with briefings from DPA and Department for Peace Operations on the political and human rights situation and the volatile conditions along the Line of Control.\nUS consent was crucial. Its position would also swing its friends on the Council. This was secured after much diplomatic effort in Islamabad and New York. Russian support was equally critical and, fortunately, they responded positively. The UK wasn’t hard to convince and conveyed its support on the eve of the meeting. The only opposition to the meeting, which China persuaded us would be a closed one to garner maximum support, came from France. Prime Minister Modi’s upcoming visit to Paris and a defence deal likely lay behind this. Among non-permanent members the most helpful was Kuwait. Indonesia came around once it saw consensus emerge for the meeting.\nNew Delhi went into overdrive to stop the meeting, with top officials frantically lobbying the capitals of UNSC members. The arguments deployed by Indian diplomats in New York were familiar — and disingenuous. Its Aug 5 action was to ‘promote Kashmir’s economic development’ by ‘integrating’ it with India; it was an internal, ‘administrative’ matter; UNSC resolutions were old and irrelevant. These arguments were easily refuted as they flew in the face of facts. UNSC resolutions remained alive, I argued, as law had no expiry date. A brutal lockdown was hardly a ‘development vehicle’. Kashmir remained an internationally recognised dispute.\nIndia’s efforts failed. The meeting convened on Aug 16, within 72 hours of Pakistan’s request, despite last-ditch efforts by an isolated France to block it. In two hours of consultations, Council members voiced concern over violations of human rights, urged an end to the lockdown and called for peaceful resolution of the dispute based on UNSC resolutions and the Charter. The UK called for an inquiry into rights abuses while the Russian representative referred to UNSC resolutions in his public remarks.\nAlthough consultations are informal meetings of the UNSC, this was a landmark development because it (i) nullified India’s claim that Kashmir was an internal matter and confirmed the international status of the dispute, (ii) reaffirmed that UNSC resolutions on Indian-occupied Kashmir remain alive and central to resolution of the dispute, and (iii) the Council’s consensus for a peaceful settlement endorsed Pakistan’s position that the dispute be resolved by negotiations, not unilateral coercive means.\nThis marked Pakistan’s first diplomatic response to India’s illegal actions and was intended to be built upon by further steps. A year on, Islamabad is expected to step up international efforts after a lull in its diplomatic campaign imposed by the pandemic."}]}

But it also encapsulated a disturbing and increasingly familiar phenomenon — the political tendency by some leaders and their followers to invent their own ‘reality’ and then project this to the public.\nRead:Politics of polarisation\nThe intense debate triggered in the US and beyond frequently recalled George Orwell’s satirical novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, in which he had coined the phrase “Newspeak” for language aimed to limit thought in his imaginary totalitarian state. Widespread discussion and a spate of books followed on the concept of a post-truth era, whose distinguishing features are seen to be the denial of objective reality, where fake news becomes the weapon of political choice and emotion takes primacy over evidence. Rejection of science and expertise are also considered its characteristics, as well as conspiracy theories.\nThis has not been an academic discussion but an effort to also describe and understand the behaviour of certain types of political leaders, especially authoritarian ones, and their followers who knowingly purvey misleading information to people and often start believing in it themselves. As a writer put it inThe Guardian, “playing fast and loose with the truth has moved from fiction to real life”. As a result, he argued, “Truth is losing its value as society’s reserve currency, and legitimate scepticism is yielding place to pernicious relativism.”\nAs a political phenomenon this is very different from the effort to project rosy or exaggerated pictures of policy and actions which governments everywhere resort to routinely. Spin too has long been common but it is different from ‘post-truth’ conduct.\nA disturbing trend is the tendency by some leaders and their followers to invent their own ‘reality’.\nThis is also related to another phenomenon that can be called the politics of delusion being witnessed in many parts of the world, including in our own region. Delusion is commonly defined as an “idiosyncratic belief or impression that is maintained despite being contradicted by reality”. In political life it is closely associated with egoistical right-wing populist leaders who use delusionary narratives to attract the public and build a larger-than-life image of themselves and their achievements. This is most tellingly epitomised by Trump. But delusionary behaviour goes beyond him and leaders like him. It has also come to pervade sections of society in many parts of the world.\nWhat has contributed to the rise of the politics of delusion? Several factors of which four, mainly overlapping ones, seem significant.\nThe obvious first one is technology and the proliferation of information platforms through which messages can be disseminated and accessed. This makes numerous avenues, where few standards are maintained, easily available to spread information, non-fact-based narratives and falsehoods too. The social media especially offers leaders and people the means to say what they want, with no check on their statement’s veracity. It provides the means to select what already aligns with their views and listen only to what they want to hear. This confines them to an information bubble, screening out views dissimilar from theirs. As there are no consequences of making false claims this reinforces delusionary political behaviour — and provides the vehicle to push like-minded people into the same state. The greater use of social media by today’s populist leaders demonstrates how delusionary narratives are so easily spread and believed.\nA second factor is extreme partisanship that characterises the stance of such political leaders and their politics. This induces the proclivity to build their own image in ways disconnected to reality in order to sharply distinguish themselves from their opponents. The kind of partisanship on display across the world — in the US, Brazil and in Pakistan too — is unprecedented in many ways. Partisan behaviour is of course not new. But in its extreme form, in which all ‘others’ are painted as venal, incompetent and even traitorous, it is different for it engenders delusionary politics. This is because those practising it also craft make-believe narratives about their own competence, claim imaginary achievements and assert untruths about their feats — all of which fail the test of reality. This inspires their supporters to echo the same messages and enlarges the space for delusionary politics.\nThus, extreme partisanship drives a ‘compulsion’ to create an alternate ‘reality’. For example, claims are often made by some leaders that they are taking a particular action for the first time in their country’s history or that no one has ever governed better than them. While such declarations are belied by facts, they are accepted unquestioningly by followers who breezily repeat them.\nThe third factor has to do with the contemporary environment in which governance has become more demanding as the world is moving much faster than the ability of governments to deliver. The expectation gap that is spawned, given a more informed citizenry, is addressed by such populist leaders with soaring rhetoric and claims of exceptionalism as well as constant attacks on opponents to show that only they are uniquely fit to govern. Again, this leads them into a delusionary state as they increasingly come to believe in their own propaganda and are blindsided to on-ground realities.\nThe fourth factor — a cause and consequence of delusionary politics — is the rejection and denigration of experts and expertise. As populist leaders often claim to be know-all about everything, informed advice is readily dispensed with, especially as such counsel punctures their delusionary bubble. Expertise is rejected not least because it limits freedom of action and exposes misleading narratives to reality checks. Just as facts are screened out so are experts with leaders willing to listen only to those who reinforce their views.\nThis phenomenon poses obvious dangers to nations across the world especially as increasing sections of society begin to descend into a delusionary state. If truth becomes so fungible and there is a growing inability to distinguish between fiction and reality, this pattern, if unchecked, could have far-reaching consequences. It can plunge nations into uncharted territory by increasing polarisation, eroding trust in public institutions and delegitimising the political process and democracy. Ultimately it could make countries more ungovernable."}]}

But the impediments encountered at every step of the way to launch intra-Afghan talks have been far more challenging than expected. This has not only delayed a process that was planned to begin on March 10 under the Feb 29Doha agreementbetween the US and the Afghan Taliban. It has also underlined the long and grinding road that lies ahead for the parties to reach any semblance of agreement on the country’s future once negotiations do begin.\nThe prisoner exchange between Kabul and the Taliban continues to be the immediate obstacle. The Taliban have insisted that before intra-Afghan talks can begin what was agreed by the Doha accord should first be implemented — the commitment by the Afghan government to release up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners. After freeing the detainees in several tranches, a prolonged impasse on releasing the remaining 400 has followed, with President Ashraf Ghani claiming that they were dangerous militants who he was averse to release. However, under immense pressure from the Americans Ghani was urged to call a Loya Jirga to find a political cover and face-saver for the prisoner release.\nWinning the peace remains a formidable challenge even though the stakes are so high.\nOnce the Jirgacleared the wayfor the release by its Aug 8 declaration, the Taliban signalled readiness for talks to begin as soon as Aug 10. That is what they conveyed to US special representative Zalmay Khalilzad. Preparations got into swing to convene the inaugural meeting in Doha. Discussion also took place about whether that meeting should be held virtually or in person on Aug 16 for which the Qataris wanted Khalilzad’s attendance. Tentative information about a Doha meeting was conveyed to many countries including Pakistan, the plan being to invite 22 states, mostly virtually.\nBut then Kabul again demurred despite the fact that Ghani signed an order for the release following the Jirga’s decision. His justification for refusing to free the remaining 320 Taliban prisoners was the same — they would pose an ‘international’ security threat and confront Western countries with a “new wave of drugs”. Rejecting this argument, the Taliban in a statement on Aug 15, declared that the accusations against these detainees were unfounded and merely an attempt by Kabul to create hurdles in the peace process and stoke international concerns.\nThe latest impasse has further vitiated the environment for the peace talks. But it has also fuelled some media speculation that the Afghan government may be dragging its feet and deliberately delaying the talks until the US presidential election, just over two months away now. The aim may be to try, if Joe Biden wins, to persuade his administration to change course or to at least slow down the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan. If true, this represents a grievously mistaken assumption. Apart from banking on an uncertain electoral outcome it also presupposes that Biden would reverse course on a process well underway, especially with Washington’s recent announcement that by election time American troops would go down to less than 5,000 in Afghanistan. This suggests that any delay-till-elections tactic would leave the Ghani government in an even weaker position than it is in now.\nUS officials can be expected to mount renewed pressure on Ghani to relent even as the Afghan president continues to stir up concerns among European countries about the release of so-called hardcore Taliban fighters. Washington has already made it evident that it wants to speedily get intra-Afghan talks going given President Trump’s desire to bring the bulk of US troops home by the November election and deliver on his previous campaign promise.\nDevelopments over the past several months, since the Doha agreement, have magnified the challenges intra-Afghan talks will face considering the obstacles that have been encountered to initiate them. Even on who the Taliban say they are prepared to negotiate with is a source of contention. On several occasions the Taliban have said they will not negotiate with the Kabul government but with the wide spectrum of ‘all parties to the conflict’. It reiterated recently that “The Islamic Emirate does not recognise the Kabul administration as a government but views it as [a] Western imported structure. We only accept negotiations that were described in the historic Doha agreement … that cover all parties to the Afghan conflict”.\nOn the two big agenda items in future negotiations — a framework agreement and a ‘comprehensive and permanent ceasefire’ — the positions of the two parties are as far apart as they can be. So also, is mutual mistrust. The Afghan government has already set a number of pre-negotiations ‘redlines’ for the talks. They include the demand for a ‘humanitarian’ ceasefire during or before the talks, no compromise on the democratic and human rights ‘gains’ made in the past decades, and ‘respect’ for the Republic’s constitution. The Taliban can be expected to push back against many of these redlines.\nOn a ceasefire, the Taliban’s preference seems clear — that agreement on a permanent ceasefire should follow and not precede the successful conclusion of negotiations on the political road map and power sharing. Only recently Taliban representatives apparently told UNAMA officials that the historical experience of similar negotiations elsewhere indicate that a ceasefire comes after and not before agreement on other substantive issues.\nReaching a framework agreement or a political settlement will pose an even greater challenge. Consensus will not be easy to evolve on vexed issues such as provisional power sharing, the Afghan constitution and human rights, and equally contentious matters relating to demobilisation of Taliban forces and their reintegration. It is hard to envision any middle ground, for example, between the Afghan government’s position to preserve the republican character of the constitution and the Taliban’s insistence on declaring Afghanistan an Emirate or Sharia state.\nTherefore, if talks commence in coming weeks the peace process is expected to be long and tough with little guarantee of a successful conclusion if the parties stick to their well-known positions. Win­n­­ing the peace in Afghanistan remains a daunting challenge even though the stakes will be much hi­­gher for all parties in post-America Afghanistan."}]}

Ensure the article presents a nuanced perspective on the subject, incorporates geopolitical insights, and maintains a formal, insightful tone."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "AN important debate underway in the US and beyond is whether Donald Trump’s defeat in the upcoming election will also spell an end to Trumpism. Some cast the election as a referendum on Trumpism. What constitutes Trumpism is itself at issue in this conversation.\nWith the presidential election less than two months away the Democratic contender Joe Biden is leading in the polls. Just as one day is a long time in politics, 60 days are even more so for an election whose outcome remains wide open. Despite the uncertainty, discussion has intensified about the implications if Trump fails to be re-elected.\nViews differ about what Trumpism stands for even though there is general agreement that it doesn’t represent any coherent ideology. It is too wrapped up with an egotistical and demagogic personality to be regarded as an intelligible or consistent set of ideas. Nevertheless, Trumpism has come to be identified with a syndrome of characteristics and attitudes, some of which have long been present in American society, that Trump did not create but are embodied in him.\nIn the debate Trumpism has variously been described as ‘right-wing nationalist, anti-establishment populism’, an “amalgam of a narrative of Trump’s business career and articulation of right-wing populist rhetoric mixed with previously fringe conservative philosophies”, a form of ‘plutocratic populism’ and a ‘zero-sum view of politics and the world’.\nA decisive Trump defeat will set back right-wing populism but not end its appeal.\nConsideration of four interrelated aspects from the cluster usually associated with Trumpism would enable an assessment of whether these will fade away with his defeat or survive beyond the election. They are: authoritarian right-wing populism, anti-establishment outlook, thinly veiled racism infused with white supremacist notions, a xenophobic, anti-immigration stance, and a unilateralist America-First paradigm of dealing with the world. The point about these strands of thinking is that they didn’t emerge with Trump but were manipulated and mainstreamed by him — and magnified. The question is will they vanish that quickly?\nIf we consider right-wing populism, it appears that while Trump’s defeat will be a setback to the phenomenon it will hardly end its appeal in the US or elsewhere in the world witnessing similar populist movements. In America it has deeper roots than Trump’s revival of ideas associated with it, previously found mainly in fringe thinking. Its invocation by Trump has partly been a reaction to America’s relative global decline and erosion of its economically predominant position. ‘Making America Great Again’, Trump’s slogan in the last election, aimed to address a ‘weakness’ he attributed to Obama and his policies rather than to changing structural realities in the US and global and domestic shifts in economic and political power.\nThe rise of Trumpian populism is also often regarded as reflecting public alienation with traditional political parties and the establishment for their inability to meet expectations especially in times of disruption caused by the uneven impact of ‘elitist’ globalisation. It seems that the underlying factors that fostered Trump’s political rise are not going to easily fade away as they now inform attitudes of significant sections of American society.\nWhat about anti-establishment sentiment which Trump has also mobilised? Again, there are reasons for the emergence of popular disaffection in recent decades as manifested in eroding trust in public institutions, which Trump has played off and fuelled by his portrayal of the deep state’s anti-people conduct. Having sought to delegitimise public institutions, can that trend be reversed if Trump loses? Probably not in the near term, while the longer-term outlook will depend on what the next president does to revive this trust. As examples from elsewhere show, once institutions are undermined it takes a long time and much effort to restore confidence.\nAs for the racial component of Trumpism this has long been a troubling though enduring aspect of America’s social landscape, with racism a systemic problem. The centrist policies pursued by both political parties in recent decades prevented racism from rearing its head. But with Trump appropriating and according respectability to white supremacist ideas a resurgence of racism occurred — evidenced in the most serious civil unrest that recently swept the country in over half a century. Again, Trump fed off and fed into the unease among a section of white society who felt that minority numbers were rising so fast as to eventually swamp them. The Trumpian slogan in the previous election of ‘Taking our country back’ was an unsubtle way of conveying this — taking it back from minorities who ostensibly ‘seized it’ in the Obama era.\nIf Trump loses, a President Biden will certainly try to play a healing role, as he has repeatedly affirmed, and seek to unify the country after the polarising and divisive Trump years. But race will continue to be a complicated issue in a country where racism remains deep seated, especially when a racist minority has amplified its voice in national affairs.\nTrumpism, like right-wing populism elsewhere in the world, is strongly infused by xenophobia and a viscerally anti-immigration stance — illustrated by Trump’s desire to build a wall along the Mexican border to shut out ‘illegal’ migrants. Its xenophobic and Islamophobic attitude is also exemplified by Trump’s infamous ‘Muslim travel ban’, which suspended travel from several Muslim countries. One of Biden’s campaign statements was that he would end this ban on his first day in office. But little change can be expected in America’s tighter immigration policies as this remains a politically charged issue, even if polls show a majority of Americans believe migrants make positive contributions to their economy.\nOn engaging with the world, a Trump defeat would likely mean a departure from extreme unilateralism as a Democratic president would return to multilateralism, rejoin global bodies, restore partnerships and repair ties with allies. Washington would arguably start dealing with the world with some respect. Perhaps on this Trumpism would see the most significant reversal.\nBut of the domestic trends evaluated above, only some and not all, will likely wane if Trump loses. A decisive defeat and bold actions by his successor may set back some ideas of right-wing populism but they would not disappear. It remains an open question whether America has been transformed — and deeply divided — by Trumpism in ways that will endure much beyond the election."}]}

Periodic review and reform are essential to reinvigorate any organisation and make it fit for purpose. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is no exception to this rule.\nFor decades little has changed in its working methods, structure, training of personnel and mode of recruitment — and thus in its outlook and approach. If foreign policy is the country’s first line of defence, Pakistan’s foreign service needs serious attention and reform.\nA frequent and justified lament heard from the ministry is that over the years it has steadily lost its centrality in the foreign policy-making process to other stakeholders in the country’s hybrid civil-military system. But the answer to this is to make the ministry more relevant, even pivotal, by improving the quality of its policy inputs and by showing initiative to stay ahead of the curve. After all, demoralisation only disempowers the institution.\nLeadership by the head of the service, the foreign secretary, is the key to revival of its once central role. But this has long been in short supply as careerism has been prioritised over professionalism. An unnecessarily timid and subservient attitude towards other stakeholders has characterised the conduct of recent holders of this office. This is a far cry from the 1990s and 2000s when foreign secretaries stood their ground to a military ruler and assertively gave policy advice to prime ministers even when that did not accord with their views.\nAs a first step a task force should be appointed to propose reforms for the PM’s approval.\nThe foreign secretary’s principal role is to lead, inspire and motivate the service by offering intellectually sound advice and resist any politicisation of decisions and personnel policy by the government of the day. A culture of open internal discussion should be fostered not of discouraging independent, out-of-the-box thinking.\nBeyond behavioural changes, a number of structural measures are essential. An adequately resourced ministry that has financial autonomy is crucial to the performance of its basic functions. It must have the means to adapt quickly to changing needs and for that it needs greater financial authority, within its allocated budget. The numerical strength of the service also needs to expand especially as the number of missions has risen, complexity of international issues has increased and so have avenues for diplomacy. The financial cost can be offset by cutting down the support staff of a tail-heavy service.\nA second structural change is to reduce the centralisation that has occurred over the years with decisions on even minor administrative matters concentrated in the foreign secretary’s office. Empowering additional secretaries and giving them greater policy responsibility will encourage initiative and fresh thinking. The director general should be the tier assigned to initiate new ideas and become the thinking post for the concerned division.\nThree, working methods should be substantially overhauled to improve communication within headquarters, between divisions still operating in silos, and with Missions. The information flow is either too slow or absent, seriously handicapping mission work. Ambassadors can only be effective if they are kept regularly briefed. Sharing of timely information is hobbled by a communication and feedback system that needs urgent modernisation, without compromising security. It also needs a change in mindset from one that prizes monopolising information over sharing it. Clear lines of communication have to be instituted for the information flow.\nFour, training requires major reform in several areas. The generalised initial training has to be replaced by more specialised training in which practical aspects of diplomacy should be taught along with knowledge of foreign policy. In other words, training modules should be focused on how to negotiate, communicate, practise public diplomacy and deal with a complex media landscape — modern tools every diplomat needs. Diverse expertise is now required on a complex array of global issues. Training should cater to these rather than be mired in mental maps of the past. The ministry’s lack of legal expertise also needs to be addressed at the training stage. This weakness was tellingly exposed during Pakistan’s representation at the International Court of Justice in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case.\nAs economic diplomacy acquires more importance, diplomats, who have long thought this wasn’t their job, need exposure to the country’s trade and business environment to be knowledgeable and effective. Above all a know-your-country (not just its foreign policy) approach is essential as sometimes diplomats appear out of sync with the domestic dynamics of a changing Pakistan.\nShort courses at mid-career can also be introduced on public diplomacy especially as new opportunities open up to deploy soft power in a more globalised world in which diverse non-state actors increasingly shape a country’s foreign policy outlook. Certainly, use of the social media should be in the diplomat’s toolkit, but as of now, the foreign ministry has yet to evolve any rules for its use.\nPromotions and postings are issues that generate much controversy and in-house resentment as they are either predicated on narrowly defined criteria (eg length of service) or favouritism rather than performance. A truly merit-based policy will lift the service’s sinking morale by rewarding the best officers, rather than those politically connected or favoured by the ministry’s top echelon.\nFinally, a longer-term reform to consider is direct recruitment to the foreign service rather than through a generalised civil service examination. Long discussed, this has always been discarded for involving cumbersome changes including in the law. But as foreign service work is very different from that of other government departments its entrance exam should serve specific service requirements. This would attract better candidates and make the initial training process focused on the skills needed for diplomacy. The process can remain entrenched in the Federal Public Service Commission.\nThe menu of reforms to make the Foreign Office fit for purpose is extensive but aversion to change should not stand in the way of measures to make Pakistan’s diplomacy more effective and able to capitalise on the opportunities unleashed by a more multipolar and multi-stakeholder world. The government can take the first step by appointing a task force to propose reforms for approval of the prime minister within a specified time frame."}]}

The 75th session of the UN General Assembly has begun at a time of deep divisions in the world even as it seeks to reaffirm the collective commitment to multilateralism, now under unprecedented stress. This is being challenged by big and regional powers trying to rewrite the rules of the game by unilateral actions, which is eroding even the semblance of a rules-based international order. This urged UN Secretary General António Guterres to recently reiterate that multilateralism is needed more than ever to “repair broken trust in a broken world”.\nMany paradoxes characterise the global landscape today. The world is more interconnected than ever before and yet so atomised. International solidarity has never been more needed to deal with common challenges but unity remains elusive. The Covid-19 crisis has thrown these paradoxes into sharper relief.\nNoreena Hertz’s new book deals with this and more. As the world grapples with the coronavirus crisis, The Lonely Century deals with another pandemic afflicting the globe, which the author argues, is both personal and political, and whose linkages and varied aspects she explores in her work, punctuated by research findings from several disciplines. She defines loneliness as not just a feeling of being unsupported in a social and familial context but also by fellow citizens, governments and the state. An example she cites is of the years preceding the coronavirus crisis when two-thirds of people living in democracies felt their governments were not acting in their interests.\nFeelings of isolation and loneliness soared, she writes, during the lockdowns and social distancing imposed by Covid-19. But what she calls the lonely century didn’t begin in 2020. Even earlier, people felt isolated and disconnected. We are, she asserts, in the midst of a global crisis of loneliness. It is also a political crisis, she maintains, fuelling divisiveness and extremism in the US, Europe and across the world, and closely connected to right-wing populism.\nThe world is more interconnected today than ever before and yet so atomised.\nShe argues that a conflation of diverse causes and events have generated a ‘lonely planet’ — “structural and institutional discrimination”, an urbanisation wave, rise of neoliberalism and fundamental changes to how we live. Smartphones and social media have also played an “integral role”, making us “more angry and tribal”. She describes neoliberalism as a particularly harsh form of capitalism and maintains that this has made us “see ourselves as competitors not collaborators, consumers not citizens, hoarders not sharers, takers not givers, hustlers, not helpers”.\nHaving known Noreena, an economist and writer, over the years, I spoke to her about her latest book and asked how she manages to write on such diverse subjects. Her first work The Silent Takeover was, as its subtitle indicated, about global capitalism and the ‘death of democracy’. It examined how governments had been losing power to private business and its impact on 21st-century politics and society. Her last book, Eyes Wide Open dealt with the present era’s information deluge and navigating this complex data landscape to make smart decisions.\nShe explained that the common theme in all her books has been to understand a world in profound change and help to shape the personal and political choices citizens have to make. Did the Covid-19 crisis motivate her to write her latest book? She said she began researching it two years ago and was completing the book when the virus struck. The global loneliness trend the book discusses predated Covid-19 but was accelerated by it. What about the connection between the loneliness phenomenon and support for right wing populism? She said populist leaders exploit vulnerable, disconnected citizens by offering a ‘manufactured or branded community’ to elicit their backing by giving them a sense of belonging.\nAs this is among the more insightful parts of the book it merits greater consideration. Hertz argues that the ties that bind people to each other and to the state have been eroding as increasing numbers of people now feel isolated and disconnected from other citizens and their governments. This trend she fears will be compounded by the pandemic as economic stress will likely fuel more disaffection from political leaders. These conditions, she shows persuasively, offer an enabling environment for extremist politicians to manipulate. They, in turn, foster even more the politics of intolerance often invoking the threat of their country being taken over by immigrants or those of other ethnicities and religions.\nOf course, perceptions of isolation are not the only factor behind support for right-wing populism. Hertz acknowledges this and recognises that populism in different countries has different underlying reasons. But she points to a growing body of data that shows that feelings of isolation and alienation have played a key role in shaping today’s fraught political landscape. And she cites the Trump phenomenon as the case of a leader exploiting people’s economic vulnerability and their sense of going unheard by traditional politicians.\nHer chapter on digital distraction, brought on by technology, and social media is also very insightful. She uses research findings to press the case that these too are contributing to the loneliness crisis. Smartphones “fragment our attention”, estrange us from people and “create a splintered self” — among other damaging effects she mentions. Apart from pushing people into isolated digital bubbles, social media is creating a meaner, more aggressive and angrier world. This is more than apparent from ‘trolling’ and offensive online behaviour. Therefore, Hertz urges the need to hold social media to account and acknowledge the great dangers of “tech addiction”.\nAs she explained to me, her aim in her book is not just to analyse the worrying trends of a lonely century but to call for action — for politicians to listen carefully to public concerns and grievances, for capitalism to align itself to the common good, for governments to address long-standing inequalities and for people to put tolerance and compassion at the heart of their pursuits. Governments have a unique opportunity “to seize the moment to rebuild our post-Covid world”.\nThe question is whether this sensible advice will be heeded by those who are shaping the destinies of their nations and of a deeply troubled world."}]}

After a protracted delay, direct talks between Kabul and the Taliban, supposed to begin in March, finally kicked off in Qatar on Sept 12. They took place following intense pressure from the Americans, intent on pressing ahead with their military withdrawal from Afghanistan in accordance with their Feb 29 agreement with the Taliban.\nAs US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the opening ceremony of the talks, this agreement set the stage for the intra-Afghan negotiations and it was now up to the Afghans to “seize the moment”. In his address to the UN General Assembly, President Donald Trump cited among his administration’s ‘achievements’ its efforts to bring an end to the war in Afghanistan, and reiterated that “we are bringing our troops home”. Elsewhere he also announced that American troops in Afghanistan will be down to 4,000 over the next few weeks, possibly ahead of the Nov 3 US presidential election. Driving this effort is Trump’s desire to make good on his election pledge that he would disengage America from its longest war.\nAll sides expect the intra-Afghan talks to be long and arduous. While talks continue in Doha violence has intensified in Afghanistan. This is evidenced by the recent Taliban attacks in Kunduz and elsewhere and air strikes by Afghan forces on their positions. Both Abdullah Abdullah, head of the Afghan High Council for National Reconciliation, and Zalmay Khalilzad, US special representative, have voiced concern over the rising violence, describing it as unacceptably high. But for fighting to continue is not surprising as any reduction of violence or a ceasefire is yet to be negotiated. Until that happens fighting will likely persist as both combatant parties try to consolidate their hold over areas they control or expand them to strengthen their negotiating hand in the talks. So military pressure will persist as an accompaniment to the talks.\nAlthough the negotiations are shrouded in secrecy what is apparent is that the two sides are for now engaged in talks about talks. A ‘contact group’ of half a dozen negotiators from each side has been meeting daily to work out the rules and an agenda for substantive negotiations and decide on next steps. This is proving to be challenging. Again, this is not unexpected as even agreeing on principles and an agenda involves compromises given the different priorities of the two sides and finding common ground on what is and what is not deemed negotiable by them. As Khalilzad asserted in a recent interview, building trust to take negotiations forward is the first and most formidable task.\nThe path to peace will not be easy as difficult compromises will have to be made.\nFundamental issues are at stake. Although the talks are principally about agenda setting, discussions are also reported to be taking place on the two big issues: a ceasefire and some form of transitional arrangement, the first being a priority for Kabul and the latter for the Taliban. The Afghan government wants at least a ‘humanitarian’ ceasefire as soon as possible but the Taliban have long made it clear that agreement on a reduction of violence or permanent ceasefire can only emerge during the talks when there is an understanding on a political settlement and not at the outset of negotiations.\nOn a transitional government, their positions cannot be more far apart. The Doha agreement left it ambiguous whether an interim government would be needed to pave the way for what the accord calls the “new post settlement Afghan Islamic government”. The deliberately vague formulations were aimed to create space for the Afghan parties to determine their own future political arrangements. Kabul has for now dismissed the possibility of any interim or provisional government arguing that this is inconsistent with the constitution. The Taliban however are unlikely to accept power sharing without a transitional political arrangement being installed.\nOn the constitution too, the positions of the two parties are as far apart as they can be, even though these issues will come up for discussion later in the substantive negotiating forum. Once the constitution is included as an agenda item in the talks as part of the ‘political framework’ that has to be eventually agreed, it will open it up for changes that President Ashraf Ghani is loath to accept. The Taliban’s demand for Afghanistan to be declared an emirate or Sharia state will obviously be resisted by Kabul, which instead insists that the country should remain a ‘republic’ as provided by the constitution. Issues relating to the protection of human rights especially women’s rights will also be contentious. Indeed, obstacles in the talks can be expected down the road on many issues. But these are matters for the future.\nA more immediate issue might be Washington’s commitment under the US-Taliban agreement to undertake a review of sanctions against Taliban members. According to the Doha agreement the US is committed to begin this process once intra-Afghan talks commenced within a specified period. Washington is also bound under explicit clauses of the Doha accord to consult other UN Security Council members in order to delist Taliban members from the Council’s sanctions list. As these obligations are not linked to or contingent upon a successful outcome of the intra-Afghan talks, President Ghani has strong reservations on this and seems to want to use the sanctions/delisting measures as a bargaining chip to secure a humanitarian ceasefire. But he is unlikely to prevail on the Americans as they seem intent on fulfilling this obligation.\nDifficult and delicate negotiations lie ahead. The path to peace will not be easy. A political settlement will require tough compromises by both the Afghan government and the Taliban. Hurdles will be encountered. But both parties must know that the Afghan people, having struggled through decades of turmoil, conflict and war, yearn for peace and expect the talks to yield an outcome that ends their country’s long night of suffering."}]}

This may open the door to unrest and political instability, putting at risk Pakistan’s much-needed economic recovery in the face of the continuing coronavirus pandemic.\nRead:Opposition trying to cause army-govt rift, says PM Imran\nFrom the All Parties Conference, emergence of anew opposition alliance, the PDM, the arrests and indictments of opposition leaders to the unceasing verbal onslaught by government ministers against their opponents, a conflation of these events has created a politically fraught environment and further fracturing of Pakistan’s polity.\nObviously, those found guilty of abusing public office for private gain must face the full force of the law. But one-sided accountability has a long pedigree in the country and has mostly been counterproductive. In July, the Supreme Courtwarnedof the consequences of politicising the accountability process, going so far as to say that accountability laws and their enforcement have been used for “political engineering”, to “pressurise” political opponents into submission and “fracturing political parties”.\nWhat is happening today has familiar echoes of the past — a government unwilling to engage with the opposition, an expedient alliance forged by a desperate opposition pledging to upend the government against a backdrop of economic gloom and governance deficits, a controversial accountability process and a deeply polarised nation. But a number of factors also distinguish the present from the past.\nA combination of factors can plunge Pakistan into uncharted territory with unpredictable consequences.\nThe state of political play today differs from the past in at least five respects. The first difference lies in the present government’s stance: a preference to rule unilaterally despite the fact that it doesn’t have a decisive mandate. Unable to secure an overall majority in the 2018 election, it needs a motley collection of allies to sustain itself in power. The point of note is that the PTI polled under a third of the votes cast, which means that about two thirds of the votes went to other parties and independents.\nThis alone should have urged humility on the PTI government and willingness to work consensually with other political parties as they represent a substantial part of the electorate. Instead, the ruling party has continued to govern as if it has an overwhelming mandate and act without consulting even its own coalition partners. Party spokesmen spend more time demonising the opposition than explaining government policy. Partisanship has taken an extreme form with the ethic of war shaping an attitude that sees opponents as enemies to be eliminated, not competitors to be engaged. Members of the ruling party claim only they have the legitimate right to rule while all others are either venal or unpatriotic. This attitude rules out any stable operation of the political system, which is a multiparty and parliamentary one, not an elected autocracy.\nTwo, past minority governments were compelled to reach out to other parties and forge alliances to govern, make the parliamentary system work, pass legislation and elicit support for policy measures. Today the government finds no incentive to do this as the ubiquitous establishment seems to have assumed the role of mobilising parliamentary votes for it on key pieces of legislation. As a result, the government is freed from the responsibility of learning the give and take of parliamentary politics and cooperation with others. This also reinforces a unilateralist mindset.\nThree, while the opposition has been under immense pressure from cases against its leaders, this has not changed the fact that it remains well-entrenched both in national and provincial legislatures and in the country’s politics. The PML-N maintains its stronghold in the country’s largest province while the PPP controls Sindh. They are far from being politically marginalised as was often the case with opposition parties in the past. They cannot be wished away, whatever the charges of malfeasance against their leaders. In fact, the latest round of arrests may have galvanised their party activists to support their leadership more vigorously.\nThe fourth difference concerns the establishment’s role. In the past, its political leverage and value lay in the wide public perception of its neutrality, which enabled it to play the role of an arbiter — resolving political conflicts when national need dictated this. In the past, determined efforts were made to at least maintain a public posture of nonpartisanship. But today, it is increasingly perceived by significant sections of the public as ­partisan, which can, over time, denude it of a vital role.\nThe fifth difference lies in a vastly transformed environment which imposes limits on authoritarian rule. The sinews of authoritarian control have weakened in a landscape that has changed fundamentally from the past, in which power and influence is more dispersed and where citizens have unprecedented access to information and avenues to get their voices heard. The mainstream and social media have much greater reach than ever before with the latter emerging as a powerful tool. Just as the PTI used it effectively in its journey to power, these means are also available to the opposition. No longer can any government control the narrative nor can old methods of suppressing opponents be successfully deployed as state power has also been eroding over time.\nThe point of underlining these differences is not simply to describe how the present has departed from the past but to underline that a combination of these factors can plunge Pakistan into uncharted territory with uncertain and unpredictable consequences for all political actors and stakeholders. In fact, the interplay between these factors makes the present situation untenable as it eliminates any political middle ground or space for engagement, which is always needed for national purposes.\nEfforts to establish de facto one party rule have all come to grief in the country’s chequered political history and have left problematic legacies. Apart from the federal nature of the polity, Pakistan is much too diverse and heterogenous for the politics of exclusion to work. Its long-term repercussions are not only deleterious for Pakistan’s fragile democracy but can also imperil national cohesion."}]}

It had unqualified support from the military, significant public goodwill, control (albeit with a razor-thin majority) of the country’s largest province and a demoralised opposition — all this, amid a popular yearning for change.\nBut as it approaches the halfway mark of its tenure, the hopes and expectations the PTI government evoked have yet to be realised. Few ruling parties have so rapidly underwhelmed their own supporters. Even for a party new to wielding governmental power, it has, at best, been underperforming.\nRead:PTI's two-year record\nTo be sure, Imran Khan’s government inherited a troublesome economic legacy that limited its ability to take popular steps. But almost every new government has had to confront a similar inheritance given Pakistan’s chronic budget and balance-of-payments deficits. True, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic threw governments everywhere off course as well as in Pakistan. But while this wreaked less havoc in the country compared to other nations it saw an unedifying initial response to the crisis by the government until a military-dominated body took charge.\nThe question now is should the government consider a course correction? The answer is yes because all governments need to identify and address weaknesses on a continual basis, especially when there is public disappointment with their performance and when a revived opposition is raising the political ante. An opinion poll by Gallup Pakistan in August shows public ambivalence about giving a positive approval rating to the government. This should be worrisome for the prime minister. An earlier Gallup survey released in March showed 66 per cent of respondents dissatisfied with the PTI government’s performance. A more recent survey by Ipsos in September found that four out of five Pakistanis feel the country is headed in the wrong direction.\nThe real game changer would be for the government to show leadership that unites the country.\nAgainst this backdrop, there are five steps the government could consider for a course correction: 1) Reframe its purpose in office and align it with public concerns 2) reconfigure its team especially in Punjab 3) Adopt a structured approach to governance 4) Evolve economic policies to spur growth by engaging the business community and political parties in parliament 5) Show respect for dissent and desist from seeing critics as enemies or traitors.\nThe first is crucial especially as the government seems embarked on a haphazard course. It should instead prioritise its agenda and focus on issues of greatest public concern and strategic interest to the country’s future. Redefining its view of the public interest means according economic issues primacy over other matters. For example, obsessive preoccupation with the opposition and a flawed accountability process shifts attention from urgent issues uppermost on the public mind.\nIf all that official spokesmen do isberate the opposition, hardly persuades people that issues that matter most to them — cost of living, unemployment, increase in utility charges, supply of essential commodities and services — are being addressed. Repurposing also means a focus on policy for all, not philanthropy for some. It involves shaking off the habit of endlessly blaming previous governments for all the country’s problems. After all, PTI was voted to power to chart a way forward not complain about the past.\nSecond, a course correction will only work if the bloated cabinet is replaced by a new, lean team that inspires confidence. It means dropping individuals who have failed to deliver. The present patchwork team is weak, disorganised and disunited with internal rifts that mar its effectiveness and credibility.\nMost importantly, reconfiguring the team should involve replacing the leadership in Punjab so that it can run the province rather than run to Islamabad for decisions. That PTI has been losing political ground in Punjab should be reason enough for the leadership to change course there.\nThree, move from the unstructured, personalised style of governance to institutional rule. Unstructured governance has led to embarrassing policy U-turns. An institutional approach ensures internal scrutiny of policy that prevents missteps. Institutional governance doesn’t mean the number of cabinet meetings that take place. It meansa consultative mode of governing in which reliance is placed on institutional advice, not the instincts of the leader. Unstructured governance is as much a result of the ruling party’s unfamiliarity with statecraft as on the way the Prime Minister’s Office is organised, which needs greater depth and experience to assist him in the complex job of governing.\nThe fourth step should involve reaching out to business leaders to build confidence and seek their views to promote the critical goal of investment without which economic growth — negative for the first time in decades — will remain elusive. Macroeconomic stabilisation is still a work in progress but will not be sustainable without achieving growth, which in turn requires investment and fostering confidence. The Ipsos Consumer Confidence Survey found that over 80pc of people lack confidence about their ability to save and invest in the future. On this critical issue the government needs to adopt an inclusive approach and engage the business community and parliamentary leaders to devise measures at a time when the World Bank is warning of a sharper Covid-induced recession in the country than expected. It should also heed the business community’s oft expressed view that NAB’s actions are casting a shadow on the revival of confidence and investment activity. The government should work with other parties on a plan for economic revival especially as the days of financial handouts from foreign donors are over.\nFinally, the government should develop a habit of welcoming, not demonising dissenting views. Adopting an intolerant attitude creates an illiberal environment which undermines democracy and denudes the government of the opportunity to test its policies against criticism. Treating opponents as enemies and dissent as sedition are hallmarks of dictatorships not democracies. Official spokesmen should try to show respect for views other than their own rather than sound like a broken record by ridiculing contrary opinion.\nThe real game changer for the country would be for the government to eschew partisanship, show the kind of leadership that unites, not polarises the country, and rise above its own instincts to provide inclusive governance."}]}

Apart from the charged environment in which the campaign is taking place, legal challenges to voting procedures have been mounting in many states — a portent of the political turbulence that may lie ahead.\nJust two weeks away, the election is being viewed with rising concern in the US and beyond over whether its outcome will produce an orderly transfer of power or become bogged down in long drawn legal battles, strife and even violence. The world watches with dismay and bewilderment at the spectacle of American democracy and institutions being undermined in the election tussle. With the country deeply polarised, political consensus over the integrity of the electoral process has eroded to such an extent that it may risk delegitimising the election outcome itself.\nSo far, the Democratic contender Joe Biden is leading in all the national polls. But the race is still close in the battleground or swing states which have greater political weight given America’s electoral college method of electing the president. A key question is whether in this election too, the winning candidate will secure more electoral college votes but lose the popular vote. This is what transpired in the previous election when Hilary Clinton won the popular vote but Trump received the requisite electoral college votes to be declared the winner.\nUnprecedented uncertainty characterises the environment in which the election is taking place. The coronavirus pandemic has injected many unknowns into the election and how it would impact polling especially voter turnout. Record use of postal ballots rather than in-person votes is being forecast, and already being witnessed in the early voting process. But the uncertainty this has triggered is whether the election infrastructure in many states has the capacity and resources to deal with millions of mail-in votes. That would also mean the electoral verdict could take days, even longer, to compute so that the outcome may not emerge on election night.\nWill the outcome produce an orderly transfer of power or lead to legal battles and strife?\nThis points to a danger being widely discussed in American political circles — of an aspirant declaring himself the winner on polling day when postal votes have yet to be fully counted, which could be decisive to the outcome. Trump has constantly questioned postal ballots assuming they would advantage the Democrats. Describing mail-in votes as a “corrupt disaster”, he has suggested they would be used fraudulently to favour Biden.\nPerhaps the greatest election uncertainty has been fuelled by Trump’s assertions that he may not accept the result if he loses and raising doubts about the election’s integrity. Although he started alleging foul play months ago, Democrats too have been questioning the election’s credibility, accusing Republican-run states of trying to suppress the vote. Meanwhile legal teams of both parties have been stepping up challenges to election rules across the country.\nA record number of legal fights are in progress especially in battleground states. As a report in the Wall Street Journal pointed out, “In some key states, lawsuits that could affect turnout and outcomes in races across the ballot are making their way through the court hierarchy and could land at the US Supreme Court.” Exacerbating this situation have been deliberate cuts in federal funding for the US Postal Service with Trump acknowledging unabashedly that he is doing this to restrict mail-in votes. Democrats have predictably accused him of voter suppression.\nAgainst this fraught backdrop the election outcome might well be disputed. Several possibilities are being speculated by American election analysts. If the result is a decisive victory for any candidate that would arguably minimise chances of a challenge. But if the result is a narrow one, legal battles may ensue and could go to the US Supreme Court, leaving the country in limbo until the dispute is resolved. While the election dispute in Florida went to the Supreme Court in the 2000 presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore, the latter accepted the verdict and conceded defeat. It is far from certain how it could play out this time.\nA significant disconnect between the popular and the electoral college vote may also serve to delegitimise the election for supporters of the candidate who wins the popular vote by a large margin but loses in the electoral college. This will not be the first time for the popular and electoral college vote to vary but in the prevailing climate it could have a different political impact.\nA grimmer scenario is also possible, as indicated by Trump’s assertions, which have fuelled much speculation in the country’s media. In this, Biden wins by a handsome margin but Trump refuses to concede and challenges the outcome, alleging voter fraud. He has made ominous statements calling for ‘election squads’ to monitor the vote to “watch all the thieving, stealing and robbing”. In the first presidential debate Trump urged a far-right group and his supporters to be ready, ostensibly to prevent ballot fraud. This is heightening tensions and more dangerously leading to attempts by right-wing militia groups to intimidate voters.\nActions by right-wing vigilantes and white supremist groups — encouraged by Trump’s stance — can provoke election chaos. This acquires greater significance in view of the fact that American security agencies now see armed white supremist groups as among the most lethal threats to the country. In Congressional testimony last month, the FBI director warned that “racially motivated violent extremism,” principally from white supremacists, represented “the majority of domestic terrorism threats”.\nAll this adds up to an election and its aftermath fraught with the risk of America’s descent into prolonged turmoil and instability — a situation succinctly summed up by Frank Bruni in aNew York Timesop-ed: “This country, already uncivil, is on the precipice of being ungovernable, because its institutions are being so profoundly degraded, because its partisanship is so all-consuming, and because Trump, who rode those trends to power, is now turbocharging them to drive America into the ground.”\nThe implications for the world of protracted instability in the US are considerable and will be discussed in a later column."}]}

The clash of narratives shines a light on the kind of political communication being used by the two sides.\nThe environment obviously shapes the messaging by both sides. The atmosphere today is marked by heightened political tensions as confrontation intensifies between the government and the opposition alliance. The opposition is hoping to leverage growing public disappointment with the PTI government’s two-year performance as rising inflation and economic hardship continue to fuel increasing discontent. The lack of governance in Punjab has also provided the opposition with political ammunition, helped by the absence of any spirited defence of the provincial leadership by PTI members.\nThe government, for its part, continues to place unifocal emphasis in its messaging oncasting the oppositionas a bunch of venal politicians more interested in diverting attention from their court cases than any concern for governance issues. Where politics is intensely personal, it is no surprise that polemics from both sides have assumed an increasingly personal nature, including character attacks — however unseemly.\nEffective public communication depends on a number of factors. They include building trust with the audience, making claims congruent with reality, framing narratives that strike a public chord by reflecting people’s concerns, avoiding ‘overkill’ or overspin and deploying credible spokespersons to make the case. Any primer on public communication aimed at shaping the political environment and popular perceptions will tell you that both the message and messenger are important to win hearts and minds.\nBeyond the war of words, confrontational politics risks plunging the country into prolonged instability.\nHow does messaging from the two sides measure up against these essentials? The government’s ability to communicate effectively is especially critical as it has to set the agenda and maintain the initiative. Governments in any case have to articulate their purpose and performance in office on a continuing basis to sustain and widen their support. It would therefore be appropriate to consider this first and in greater detail.\nThe most striking aspect of the government’s messaging is its predominantly negative nature. Statements by official spokespersons are overwhelmingly dominated by how corrupt and unpatriotic the opposition is. This reflects an obsessive preoccupation with the opposition and while it aims to denude political adversaries of legitimacy, such rhetoric tells the public little about how the government is dealing with people’s problems.\nIn fact, disproportionate focus on deriding opponents does two things. It creates an impression that officials have little to say on the government’s performance. And constant harping on a single theme produces public fatigue with a hackneyed message. The principal task of spokesmen is to articulate and explain official policy not just demonise adversaries. Endlessly engaging in the latter creates a disconnect with public concerns as these are eclipsed by incessant verbal assaults on the opposition. That also does little to build public confidence.\nAnother aspect of the PTI’s strategy is to roll out its spokesmen as often as possible — as witnessed after the opposition’s public rallies and the shockingKarachi incident— sometimes several times in the day, to blunt the opposition’s criticism. Mounting the airwaves with a competing ‘story’ to prevent opponents from dominating the media is a time-worn tactic and common in politics everywhere. But to do so every few hours with the same message is tiresome for the audience and counterproductive as news is created by saying something new, not being an echo chamber churning out worn-out messages that people switch off from.\nThe problem is compounded when spokespersons delivering the government’s message lack political standing and persuasive appeal. The PTI has enough people to effectively convey its messages than those its leadership has chosen. In Punjab, for example, their main capability seems to be the number of insults they can hurl in pressers rather than any communication skill. Defence of the government has to rest on facts, arguments and rational points, not on ridicule and slander of others. This actually does the leadership a disservice.\nAn unfortunate aspect of the political culture today, to which the ruling party has contributed, is the use of abrasive and incendiary language in political conversation, upending norms of political debate. This has debased the political discourse and undermined the image of the government of being a mature team while eroding public respect for politicians in general. People expect elected representatives to set an example of responsible leadership, not use the immoderate language of a street brawl.\nThe opposition’s focus is obviously on exposing what it sees as the ruling party’s ineptitude and failure to govern competently. While some of its spokespersons have been effective it too needs to raise the game in its messaging. It is also resorting to personal attacks which has two effects. It detracts from issues on the public mind and shifts focus away from the country’s problems that need to be addressed. Of course, the principal role of oppositions everywhere is to subject government policies and actions to scrutiny. But it is also to explain how it would solve national problems. That has been lacking in the opposition’s messaging. Crucial for building wider public support is to convey how the opposition would deal with issues that it critiques the government for failing to tackle. Its main message is also lost in long-winded and verbose public speeches by some of its leaders, who need to speak less about their plight and more about the people’s concerns.\nA challenge for the heterogeneous opposition alliance is how to speak with a coherent voice on key issues especially its principal objectives and tactics. The PDM’s 26-point resolution — a common minimum agenda — is one thing, but core messages are quite another as it is the latter that impacts on the public. On this count speeches and pressers by opposition leaders leave questions on the public mind about whether these parties even agree on the main goal.\nWords have consequences. But beyond the war of words, confrontational politics can plunge the country into prolonged instability in tough economic times with far-reaching repercussions for all stakeholders. Non-stop political combat also risks a loss of public confidence in political leaders, which can be consequential for Pakistan’s democracy."}]}

There are at least five features of the fraught political landscape creating uncertainty about the future at a time when both internal and external challenges abound. The interplay between them risks making the situation more volatile and precarious.\nOne, there is no let-up in the confrontation between the government and opposition or easing in the war of words between them. The acerbic rhetoric being used against each other is continuing to inject a toxic element in the overall environment. In the battle of pressers each side is making incendiary accusations against its opponents. Parliamentary proceedings offer the unedifying spectacle of harsh invective being exchanged with both sides calling the other traitors.\nTwo, opposition unity has been cemented by the government’s rhetoric and actions. What is now an Imran Khan vs the Rest line-up, 11 PDM parties are arrayed against the government with the opposition alliance representing a wide national spectrum. The PTI government’s political challenge is compounded by less than explicit support from its erstwhile coalition allies, conspicuous by their virtual silence on the government-opposition conflict.\nThe third aspect and related to the second, polarisation is sharpening with the middle ground being eliminated in the country’s politics. The trust deficit between the political adversaries has so widened that occasional — but much needed — cooperation even on issues of common interest and national importance is becoming rarer.\nBoth sides should step back from confrontation and engage in a national dialogue to solve problems.\nFour, the establishment is being sucked into the political game despite its stated desire to stay away from it. The opposition’s strategy is to raise the costs of what it believes is the establishment’s partisan role while the government, in repeatedly claiming the army’s backing, is unintentionally cre­­­a­­ting the same effect — making the estab­lish­ment central in the political tussle — and media debate.\nThe fifth and most important aspect of the current situation is that the rising political temperature and intensifying conflict is distracting attention from the country’s challenges with a potentially negative impact on the economy. Instability is the enemy of economic recovery at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic is causing economic stress and undermining prospects of reviving investment and growth. Shifting official focus from issues on the public mind is eroding people’s confidence in a government they see as engaged more in combative politics than evolving policy to address bread-and-butter issues especially when inflation is hitting people hard.\nWhat does this add up to? For a start, an extremely unpredictable situation that could spin out of everyone’s control and plunge the country into uncharted territory where there may be no winners. Already a confluence of these factors makes the situation untenable for all actors. How long can the government that lacks an overall parliamentary majority and control of a key province insist it will have no truck with any opposition party and rule unilaterally? How long can the opposition sustain its protest movement? How long can both sides ignore people’s problems without risking a loss of public support? How long can the establishment pretend it can stay out of a political confrontation that keeps drawing it in one way or another?\nThree scenarios can be extrapolated from this state of play. The first is a no-change scenario in which confrontation continues and leads to a prolonged uptick in political tensions, disruption of parliamentary business, and escalation in the war of words between the government and opposition. This engenders more instability and morphs into a political crisis if PDM carries out the threat of resig­nation from national and provincial legislatures.\nIn this scenario attention from national challenges is diverted when the economic situation and security threats (indicated by recent terrorist incidents) warrant not just undivided official attention but across-the-board national support. Polarisation also prevents the political consensus necessary to execute measures to meet a challenging economic situation. This scenario will likely result in the country lurching from one crisis to another and unable to tackle deep-seated problems much less solve them.\nIn the second scenario the government resorts to restrictive measures to contain the opposition and imposes more undeclared curbs on the media’s ability to report freely. This may be accompanied by acceleration of an accountability process already mired in controversy but which can further be denuded of legitimacy. This might be an improbable scenario due to the high political cost of a repressive response and also because of its feasibility in making such measures stick in what after all remains a federal democracy. ‘Containment’ in any case is unlikely to work as Pakistan’s history testifies and will only hasten the country’s descent into political disorder.\nThe third scenario is where all sides step back acknowledging that the political system can be endangered by long-drawn-out confrontation and engage in a political dialogue to resolve core differences. In this the establishment too plays a role in defusing the situation to avert a runaway crisis. This is by far the most desirable scenario even if it appears difficult to achieve. It may be too tall an order to expect both sides to forge a new ‘national contract’ given their bitter rivalry but agreement on the rules of the game can and should be evolved. Consensus on dealing with economic and security challenges should also form part of the dialogue. Once there is agreement it should have the support of all institutions.\nThe risks to the country’s unity and stability from the first and second scenarios are so high that this should urge both the government and opposi­tion to seriously consider entering a meaningful dialogue. The initiative has to obviously come from the government as many opposition leaders already seem positively inclined. The dialogue should aim to forge an understanding on working the political system and evolving agreement on a national course of action to address the policy challenges that are pivotal to the country’s future. The people of Pakistan expect no less from their leaders."}]}

Never has the world watched with such concern the political tensions, bitter rhetoric and legal fights that marked the turbulent run-up to the election. The close race kept people on edge for days following the election as votes were counted in the crucial battlefield states.\nThe American peoplechose Joe Bidento lead their country in what has been described as ‘an election of a lifetime’ which will have “decade-defining consequences”. This has come as a relief to many people in America and beyond. For the international community the overarching question is how the new occupant of the White House will change American foreign policy in the post-Trump era.\nTo begin with, Biden will be preoccupied with managing domestic challenges with the pandemic still wreaking havoc across the country, polarisation undermining national cohesion and racial tensions waiting to be seriously addressed. Uniting a deeply divided country will undoubtedly be his first order of business. As he reiterated after the election: “I will govern as an American president. There will be no red states and blue states. Just the United States of America.”\nThe outcome of the Congressional election too will present a challenge as the Senate is likely to remain in Republican control. This will pose formidable problems of divided government and legislative gridlock. Biden will be obliged to deal with an unfriendly Senate which will make governance difficult while his pledge to heal a divided nation will require vigorous efforts. As an op-ed writer asserted in theNew York Times, the election will not resolve “America’s deepest problems” — social crisis, breakdown of political culture, and feelings of exclusion. That Trump got more popular votes now than in 2016 indicates how widespread support remains for ‘Trumpism’. If Trump continues to play an active political role this could further complicate Biden’s task. Domestic troubles then will warrant his sustained attention.\nBiden will depart in fundamental ways from Trump’s erratic and unpredictable policies.\nBut as a course correction is also needed in America’s relations with the world this will not wait for the domestic agenda to be tackled. Some argue that this is where Biden may have a less constrained hand. What then is a Biden presidency likely to do? The selection of his foreign policy team will be an early pointer to the foreign policy he will pursue.\nAs someone with rich experience in foreign policy — having long served as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee and as vice president — Biden is expected to follow a more traditional approach fundamentally different from Trump’s unpredictable and whimsical policies pursued at great detriment to America’s global standing. In contrast to Trump’s intensely unilateral ‘America First’ policy, Biden, known as a liberal internationalist, would seek to restore his country’s multilateralist credentials. During the campaign he declared that the ‘America First’ policy had resulted in ‘America Alone’ and he would seek to ‘restore America’s leadership’.\nIn broad brush terms a Biden administration is likely to see: the revival of a more stable foreign policy, renewal of commitment to multilateralism, reaffirmation of relations with allies, reversal of Trump’s abandonment of the Iran nuclear deal, re-engagement with key international institutions, return to the Paris climate agreement and recommitment to alliances especially Nato.\nA key priority for Biden will also be to mend America’s damaged international reputation evidenced in several surveys. A recent Pew Research survey found that America’s global image had plunged to an all-time low. It showed that several countries among Washington’s allies have an unfavourable view of the US especially of Trump. Clearly four years of Trump’s disruptive impact on the world and the blows delivered to an already fraying rules-based international order have dented America’s standing, eroded its influence and diminished its soft power. Biden will try to reverse that.\nOn Afghanistan and the US commitment to withdraw its remaining forces, Biden’s policy will not differ much from Trump’s. He has long been a critic of America’s prolonged military engagement and as vice president had opposed the military surge President Barack Obama ordered in 2009. Asked in an interview earlier this year what he would do if the Taliban ended up in power he said: [I have] “zero responsibility. The responsibility I have is to protect America’s national interest and not put our women and men in harm’s way to try to solve every single problem in the world by use of force.”\nA significant departure from Trump’s policy would be re-entering the Iran nuclear deal. Biden has repeatedly asserted he would re-commit to JCPOA if Iran complied and seek to strengthen it with partners. He believes this would help to re-establish US credibility. In the Middle East, it remains an open question how Biden’s frequent criticism of Saudi Arabia would translate into policy. His support for Israel will continue to be firm, in line with long-standing US policy.\nThe biggest foreign policy challenge will remain America’s relations with China — this century’s most consequential bilateral relationship with far-reaching global impact — which Trump pushed into a state of intense hostility by his confrontational approach. Given the anti-China mood and bipartisan consensus in the US, Biden will likely adopt a tough line. But while continuing to engage in strategic competition — and containment — Biden will be less combative and abrasive than Trump and look for areas of cooperation on global issues such as climate change. For its part, China will want to stabilise relations by reaching out to President-elect Biden. China’s vice foreign minister recently expressed the hope that the new administration would work with China and “meet it halfway to focus on cooperation and manage differences”.\nPredictability and stability in US foreign policy would be the most important change from the Trump years. But it is the home front where bitter discord and divisions have made the country virtually ungovernable that will receive the greatest attention from the next president. A Financial Times editorial put it succinctly: “No postwar president has taken over a more beleaguered nation.”"}]}

There were two noteworthy aspects of these parleys. One, that a coalition partner, PML-Q, chose to stay away while stating the reason quite plainly. Its leadership was quoted as saying, “The party’s commitment is to support the government, not attend lunches.”\nThat the PTI government in Punjab is critically dependent for its survival on PML-Q’s support underlines the political significance of its leadership’s displeasure with Islamabad. This was not the first time the party declined to attend an event by the prime minister. A budget eve dinner for allies was similarly boycotted by PML-Q. The reason goes beyond a lack of respect shown for its leaders; it is the party leadership’s annoyance with how Punjab is being run as well as misgivings on other issues.\nTwo, the litany of complaints voiced at the Nov 5 luncheon laid bare the depth of allies’ frustration with a government that seems to take them for granted. According to those who attended the meeting, grievances ranged from lack of access to development funds and projects to concern about rising inflation, which the government, they believe, has been unable to contain. But the overarching complaint was lack of consultation on key policy and not taking them on board on the government’s strategy towards the opposition. The leader of a rural Sindh party went so far as to say that while they were allies, the government did not treat them as such. It seems that the lesson has gone unlearnt from BNP-M’s parting of ways with the government earlier over what its leader Akhtar Mengal called unfulfilled commitments.\nThis draws attention to a striking characteristic of the PTI government — its inability to learn much less hone the art of political management, which is integral to governance. This may stem in part from a mindset that prefers to rule unilaterally. But it also speaks of an attitude that sees governance as a narrowly technocratic task rather than a political one too. It may also have much to do with the government’s reliance on the establishment to undertake political management on its behalf thus obviating the need for it to engage allies on a sustained basis and address their concerns.\nLack of governance in Punjab has been consequential as PTI has steadily lost political ground there.\nPolitical management isn’t just about engaging with coalition partners. It is also about managing the affairs of its own party. Here the ruling party has constantly exhibited a lack of discipline with ministers and parliamentary members routinely contradicting each other, and sometimes making assertions at odds with the leadership’s position. This has prevented a coherent stance from being articulated despite, or perhaps because of, the bevy of spokespersons deployed for public messaging. Also, a complaint from party backbenchers continues to be lack of access to the leadership.\nBut it is the government’s weak political management in Punjab that has emerged as the PTI government’s Achilles heel. Examples of mismanagement by the ineffectual Punjab leadership abound. TheLahore CCPO affairthat prompted the exit of the respected IG police must rank among the more egregious. Frequent changes of chief secretaries and top police officials also illustrate the chaotic management of the country’s largest province. This lack of governance has been consequential as the party has steadily lost political ground in the province, while its bitter foe, PML-N has made gains.\nThen there is the broader question of managing the political system and dealing with the opposition. Effective management requires dealing with it in a manner that enables the government to keep the initiative in its hands and its narrative convincing enough to dominate the opposition’s criticism. It is also in the government’s interest to ensure that the political environment remains calm so that it can focus on the country’s challenges. This necessitates inclusive governance that creates space to secure cooperation across the aisle when needed for legislation and to elicit support for policy actions.\nAs the PTI government from the outset ruled out collaborative governance and opted instead for a combative approach towards those who did not support it, this raised even more compelling political management issues. But the inability to accept the very notion of opposition as legitimate became a fundamental impediment in evolving an effective political strategy. When the opposition went into confrontational mode the government faced a situation where 11 parties began to mount collective pressure in an increasingly charged atmosphere. So, the test of political management became even more imposing. In the battle now underway the PTI leadership needs all the political skills it can muster to deal with the challenge.\nHow has it fared? So far, its political response has been reactive, assuming the form of constant press conferences and seeking to dominate the airwaves by hurling repeated volleys of insults and accusations against the opposition. Even during the Gilgit-Baltistan election, campaigning reflected just this, not what the party would do for people’s welfare. This negative campaigning descended intomisogynist attackswhich were roundly condemned across the country but tellingly, the concerned minister was never reprimanded by the leadership. Rhetoric sunk to another low when a minister accused all those supporting opposition parties of being disloyal to the country.\nVerbal abuse and disingenuous accusations do not add up to a political strategy. If that is all the ruling party counts on then it reflects the vacuousness of its political approach and does little to strengthen the government’s hands. It is government performance and projecting it, which should form the most important part of the ruling party’s response to the opposition. But that seems to be almost missing. Parliament too is an arena underutilised by the government in its political strategy to demonstrate that it is firmly in charge and working for people’s welfare.\nA sound political management strategy needs to build public confidence by showing government performance and legislative activism, keep allies happy, ensure coherence in party ranks and counter the opposition’s campaign by effective political means. On all these counts the PTI government still has much to learn."}]}

The first and obvious one is effective governance and the second is national resilience.\nThe global debate about governance has intensified at a time when leaders are still struggling to balance conflicting concerns in addressing a health crisis that rages on despite hopeful reports about a vaccine.\nFareed Zakaria’s new book \"Ten Lessons for a Post-Pandemic World\" doesn’t just deal with the governance aspect but also the world’s changing landscape. The book, he explains, is not about the pandemic but about the world that has emerged from it and influenced by responses to the crisis. For him, the pandemic did not usher in new global trends but accelerated those already in play. The 10 lessons he draws are based on intricate arguments and include: the need to balance speed of human development with safety, quality not quantity of government matters, markets remain insufficient, experts should be heeded but they too should listen to people, inequality should be addressed, globalisation will endure, and a bipolar world has emerged.\nThe tour d’ horizon of global realities is breezily written but it is the chapter on governance which warrants consideration here. Zakaria raises the question widely debated during the pandemic, whether democracies or authoritarian systems have managed the crisis better. He concurs with the view that democracies have done better. But what about the US and Britain? He argues that mishandling by the former is an American not a democratic disease. And he identifies a “competent, well-functioning, trusted state” or the quality of governance to have been instrumental in tackling the pandemic effectively.\nEffective governance and national resilience have been two key factors in an efficient pandemic response.\nIn a recent podcast Francis Fukuyama made a similar assertion but maintained that it was not the type of political system that determined efficient management but an effective state. In an essay written in March he argued that the crucial determinant in efficient crisis response is state capacity and trust in government. “What matters in the end is not regime type but whether citizens trust their leaders, and whether those leaders preside over a competent and effective state.”\nFor Zakaria the key question is why some states have governments that work well when others don’t. He notes that a competent bureaucracy and the ability to tax have been key factors in the history of modernisation and he cites the example of Singapore that has also been advantaged by “highly disciplined and focused leadership”.\nHe evaluates America’s weaknesses and attributes them to its anti-statist tradition, distrust of government and uneven efforts to establish a strong and efficient national state. Today, he writes, “the US has fewer government officials per capita than most other advanced democracies”. American federalism has created its own problems of paralysis and gridlock. He shows how disordered American government has been, failing to address pressing challenges for a generation while coasting along on a combination of “dynamic economics and dysfunctional politics”. He concludes that America should learn good governance from the world and undertake reforms which include making the government a more important economic actor and delivering better public services.\nGovernment performance and effectiveness has been intensely reviewed during the pandemic but the debate has obviously gone on for a much longer time. The past decade witnessed a trend strengthening in the West of growing public discontent with governments and declining confidence in their ability to deliver. This prompted much discussion of the weaknesses of Western democratic systems.\nSuccessive annual Global Risk Reports of the World Economic Forum warned of rising popular disaffection with Western democracy. The 2019 report stated that “many Western democracies are struggling with political fragmentation and polarisation that have complicated the process of providing stable and effective governance”. It added that “weak governance raises serious questions about numerous countries’ political health”.\nThe rise of anti-establishment right-wing populism or new authoritarianism further intensified the debate about factors behind the growing public disaffection with traditional parties and elites and deepening mistrust of government institutions. The strains these developments imposed on democracy were widely commented on as were governance failures fueling nationalist populism.\nThis debate has already produced much literature. One book of this genre published some years back offered instructive insights and made an important contribution to this conversation. Intelligent Governance for the 21st Century by Nicolas Berggruen and Nathan Gardels examined why political systems were not delivering effective governance and whether there was a need to reimagine government. The authors rejected the idea that only Western ideas and systems should be the paradigm in discussion while pointing out that both Western and Eastern political systems need correction. Both confronted common challenges they were increasingly unable to cope with.\nThe answer lay in drawing on the best practices of both East and West to find a ‘middle way’ that would recalibrate political systems and evolve hybrid institutional arrangements. They saw strengths and vulnerabilities in both and suggested they learn from each other, fusing “knowledgeable democracy” with the Confucian tradition of a learned “accountable meritocracy”.\nThe book saw most Western governance systems stymied by dysfunction. Terminal decay was certain without reform, claimed the authors, as electoral democracy, anchored in a consumer culture of instant gratification, was self-interested and short term, and de-emphasised any notion of the long term and common good.\nIn contrast, China took a long-term governance perspective, could take difficult decisions and implement them robustly. Imbued with the Confucian values of education and ethics, its system is based on the meritocratic tradition of learned and experienced elites, as reflected in the Communist Party’s modern mandarinate. This, the authors argued, has empowered the country to chart its long-term future and is responsible for its extraordinary rise. Nevertheless they stressed that its system needs correction by instituting accountability as popular demands grew for democratic checks on arbitrary authority.\nThe idea of evolving a template of intelligent government by drawing on the best attributes of East and West and balancing meritocracy and democracy is a compelling one. Practicable or not, Pakistan has much to learn from the rich debate on governance that continues."}]}

Not really. Factors other than troop levels are more significant for the future of peace talks. In any case, troop levels have progressively been going down since the Doha agreement of February between the US and the Taliban. The drawdown of another 2,000 troops, planned by mid-January, will likely have limited impact on the situation especially as the US will still retain air power and maintain a CT capability.\nAlso, several thousand Nato-led international forces are present to train, advise and assist Afghan forces and aim to leave when ‘conditions allow’. Above all, international leverage will now shift from military to economic means — the military option being all but exhausted.\nNevertheless, the key to Afghanistan’s future is whether the intra-Afghan dialogue can make enough progress towards a settlement, including a ceasefire, before all international forces leave Afghanistan and global interest wanes. The intra-Afghan process that began in September as a consequence of the Doha accord faces imposing challenges. Delays in its initiation were due to wrangles between Kabul and the Taliban over prisoner exchanges. Once these disagreements were resolved the dialogue got underway in Qatar. Talks are now reported to be nearing agreement over procedures and terms of reference (TORs) for negotiations. This will open the way to talks on substantive issues including a ceasefire. The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’svisit to Dohaand meeting with the Taliban’s chief negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar was aimed at accelerating the peace talks following the Pentagon announcement.\nNot everyone agrees that a speedier pullout of troops will have marginal effect. After 2,000 are pulled out in January — under the Doha accord this was to happen in May 2021 — about 2,500 American troops will be left in Afghanistan. Some media reports indicate how several US allies have been “rattled” by this decision, which obviously seeks to make good President Donald Trump’s pledge to bring American soldiers home before he leaves office. The chairman of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation, Abdullah Abdullah, said while he respected this decision “it has come too soon”. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg cautioned that the “price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high”.\nIt is up to the Afghan parties to make the tough compromises needed to secure a settlement.\nSome Congressional Republicans and American ana­­lysts fear that this accelerated exit would tou­g­hen the Taliban’s negotiating position. For their part, the Taliban havewelcomedthe US announcement as a “good step” that would help bring an end to the war.\nWhile Pakistan has repeatedly called for a “responsible US troop pullout”, officials were neither surprised nor worried about the latest development and believe this might even encourage Washington to step up and impart more urgency to diplomatic efforts to goad the Afghan parties into accelerating progress in substantive negotiations.\nThe incoming administration of Joe Biden is not likely to change course on the military drawdown especially as this has now gone so far ahead. Moreover, the president-elect has in the past not favoured continued military engagement in Afghanistan and instead urged an end to “forever wars”. There is speculation that his administration might slow down the pullout of remaining US forces in deference to the view of many defence officials and Nato allies. This too is unlikely to make an appreciable difference to the on-ground situation in Afghanistan. A key question is how early and substantively the Biden administration focuses on the Afghan issue given its heavy domestic agenda and other more pressing foreign policy priorities.\nThe current uptick in violence in Afghanistan is worrisome for all stakeholders including the country’s neighbours. This figured prominently in talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan when Prime Minister Imran Khan recently visited Kabul. Some intensification of violence was expected as the Afghan parties seek to expand areas under their control to strengthen their negotiating hand. But this does not explain the pattern of increased violence. There is a puzzling aspect to some of the urban violence and terrorist attacks which raises the question of whether this is being orchestrated by internal and external spoilers who are loath to see the talks make headway. True or not, the spike in violence is creating an extremely fraught environment and adding to the uncertainty that clouds the peace talks. However, once TORs are formally agreed the next phase of talks is expected to focus on the reduction of violence — crucial to create an atmosphere of trust and calm for the arduous negotiations that lie ahead.\nMeanwhile, a pledging conference for Afghanistan that took place recently in Geneva, co-hosted by the UN and Finland, and attended mostly virtually by 100 countries and international organisations, saw the US, EU and other donors commit around $3 billion for Afghanistan next year and $12bn over the next four years. What was significant was that pledges were conditioned on tangible progress in peace talks and a ceasefire although the EU also made assistance contingent on the ‘preservation of human rights gains’. A top US official announced that while it was pledging $600 million for 2021, only half would come now “with the remaining available as progress in the peace process is reviewed”. Pompeo was more direct:“The choices made in peace negotiations will affect the size and scope of future international support and assistance.”\nThis underlines that the international community’s economic leverage will be more important in the months ahead than other means to influence the negotiating parties into making progress. Both Kabul and the Taliban see continuance of international assistance as necessary as they know that without funds state collapse is threatened. Even though international influence will diminish over time economic incentives rather than coercive pressure will be the likely vehicle to influence the peace process.\nPakistan, Afghanistan’s other neighbours and the international community have obvious if varying stakes in the country’s peaceful future and will try to assist in whatever way they can. But it is up to the Afghan parties to make the difficult compromises needed to secure a peace settlement. Afghanistan’s destiny can only be determined by Afghans themselves."}]}

The confrontation between the government and opposition shows no sign of easing. Instead, the political temperature has risen to a fever pitch and a bitter power struggle continues to rage. This is unlikely to produce any winners. It puts at risk serious management of the pandemic’s second wave, efforts for the country’s economic recovery and responses to a volatile regional security situation. Deepening political polarisation is already casting a shadow on efforts to effectively address these internal and external challenges. The political paralysis that looms will only exacerbate this grim situation and leave people more dispirited about the future.\nThe positions of the two sides are now so far apart that any political space or meeting ground has all but been eliminated for a national dialogue, which seemed a sensible way out of this stand-off. The PTI government has repeatedly insisted that it will not countenance a dialogue on an NRO which it claims is all that the opposition wants to discuss despite vehement denials by the latter. The opposition for its part, has been calling for Prime Minister Imran Khan’s resignation, which too rules out any ground for talks.\nOf course, political rivals often adopt maximalist positions that can be narrowed down in purposeful negotiations. But both sides have now dug their heels in and adopted such extreme and uncompromising postures that chances of any dialogue seem to have been overtaken by these hardened positions. The incendiary rhetoric employed by both sides has further vitiated the atmosphere. Government spokesmen continue to cast the opposition as looters and foreign agents while opposition leaders have dubbed the PTI leadership as a virus worse than Covid-19.\nBefore the second wave of the pandemic began afflicting the country, and in anticipation of this widely predicted danger, the government could arguably have reached out to the parliamentary opposition to keep it briefed on a continuing basis on the Covid-19 situation. Leading from the front, it could have acted proactively and created the conditions for cooperation in this regard. Instead, it only started issuing public exhortations once the opposition had already embarked on its jalsa plans. Opposition leaders too did not take any initiative to ask the authorities — the NCOC for example — to bring them up to speed on the pandemic and take a reasoned decision on that basis. Fearful they would lose the momentum created by their public campaign PDM leaders dismissed calls to limit or postpone their rallies.\nThe political confrontation leaves the country in a precarious place at a time of extraordinary challenge.\nThe opposition’s decision to go ahead with itsMultan rallytook the government-opposition confrontation to a new peak. Thejalsawent ahead in defiance of government restrictions and hurdles, and while scuffles between opposition supporters and local authorities remained limited, they held out the spectre of more serious clashes ahead as the PDM announced it would not back down from plans to hold more rallies and a ‘long march’ on the capital. That people were willing to attend opposition rallies in disregard of the virus threat showed both the extent of public disaffection with the government as well as underlined the danger of rallies becoming superspreader events.\nWhere does this leave the country? In a precarious place at a time of extraordinary challenge. Both the government and opposition are now trapped in a vicious cycle from which neither has the intent nor will to escape. This poses risks to the country. For a start the intensifying political conflict will be an obvious hurdle in efforts to get the pandemic under control before a vaccine becomes available and can be distributed. Even now it is perhaps not too late for detailed briefings to be given to opposition representatives, in parliament for example, to encourage understanding of the risks they are running and the negative impact on public perceptions of their conduct in the midst of a health emergency.\nApart from Covid-19, prolonged confrontation between the government and opposition can also imperil the country’s much-needed economic recovery after the ravages caused by the pandemic to an already fragile economy. Rebound from a virus-induced economic recession depends critically on establishing an environment of political calm and tranquillity and evolving a political consensus to support the measures instituted to affect a turnaround. The government should accept that this is as much a political as a technocratic task and the initiative to create the necessary atmosphere for economic activity rests with it. Already shortages of essential commodities and gas are causing people daily hardship. This urges the need for a political truce.\nSo does the regional security situation — an implacable foe on the eastern border directing subversive activities in the country and intensifying repression in occupied Kashmir while uncertainties mount on the western frontier with escalating violence in Afghanistan. This calls for national cohesion in the face of external challenges.\nAgainst this backdrop what is needed is a strategic pause in the political battle to afford an opportunity for both sides to step back, introspect, rethink and consider how to engage for a cause higher than themselves — the country. Not a tactical pause of standing down only to ready themselves to continue a battle of attrition but a strategic one that opens the way to a change in approach — by both sides. The establishment may have to play a role in helping to move the two parties towards such a strategic pause which could then enable the government and opposition to reconsider their positions and think of how to put the interest of the country foremost in their strategies.\nBy accepting a pause including in the war of words, neither side need see itself as having submitted to the other. This may then create an atmosphere where a dialogue could eventually become possible giving the country much-needed respite from political turmoil. It will also be an opportunity for the government to show it can put aside its brand of exclusionary politics to represent the entire nation, not just its own supporters."}]}

More than evident in the pre-pandemic era this came into sharper relief after Covid-19 struck. The issue of trust was in the spotlight when handling of the coronavirus crisis was assessed and it was found that where people had greater trust in their government, they listened to health advisories and complied with restrictions. This enabled authorities to manage the crisis better. The reverse held true in countries where trust was low, which compromised the government’s ability to tackle the disease.\nThis has not been a function of the type of political system of a country. Instead, it has been a reflection of people’s confidence in how competent their leaders have been in responding to the challenge. Positive perceptions helped build trust in governments.\nBut why has trust been declining in governments which today is accepted as a global phenomenon? A review of the literature on this — books and knowledgeable essays — reveals that multiple factors and their interplay may be responsible. The more plausible among those identified are the sheer scale and complexity of governance today, rising and unmet expectations, growing disconnect between political elites and the public, governments becoming too remote from citizens, economic performance becoming the touchstone of people’s evaluation of competence, conduct of leaders, and the information revolution that has empowered people in ways that are truly unprecedented.\nWith a world moving at hyper speed, governments struggle to keep pace and are seen to act and deliver much too slowly. The short-term approach usually adopted by political leaders often overrides acting in the public interest in the long term. Many political leaders operate with mental maps of the past and do an unedifying job of understanding and responding to people’s sentiments and grievances. All these factors undermine trust between rulers and the ruled.\nBoth sides risk losing the trust of the people they seek to serve.\nThere is little doubt that a more informed citizenry with access to multiple channels of information is more empowered and has several platforms available to make their voices heard. This empowerment also produces higher expectations which morphs into popular discontent when governments are unable to deliver and address public demands. Therefore, technology has much to do in being a driver of mounting expectations.\nThe trust debate is hardly new even if its context has been changing. Reports that track global risks published annually by the World Economic Forum (WEF) have been highlighting this phenomenon for over a decade now. One of its reports, in assessing trust, called attention to a “legitimacy deficit” which referred to a sense that “we might nearly be better off without rulers”. The report observed this trend across the world in countries in very different stages of development.\nHarvard scholar Joseph Nye, writing in one of WEF’s Global Outlook Reports, stressed the need for democracies to adjust to the long-term decline of trust in elected governments and the new challenges of the information age. This decline has been confirmed by several surveys. For example, a report last year found only 45 per cent of citizens in OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries trusted their government.\nScholars such as Nye tackled this rising trust deficit mostly from a Western perspective. A book that comes to mind in this regard isThe Fourth Revolutionpublished some years back but still relevant for its insights. Its authors, John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, argued that the West must address what they called the “7 deadly sins” which seemed to lie behind falling confidence. They include overlapping areas of responsibility in oversized governments, surrender of too much power to special interests and political paralysis and gridlock.\nMore recently, well-known scholar Francis Fukiyama wrote about the crisis of trust in the US and again, his observations have wider applicability. He argued that trust is built on two foundations. One, “citizens must believe that their government has the expertise, technical knowledge, capacity, and impartiality to make the best available judgments” — which of course speaks to government competence. The second foundation is “trust in the top end of the hierarchy”, in leaders and whether they inspire public confidence in knowing what they are doing and acting in the public interest.\nA recently published book,Democracy and Globalisation: Anger, Fear and Hopeby Josep M. Colomer and Ashley L. Beale, examines the issue from a fresh angle. Its authors explore the causes of what they see as the current crisis of democracy and why trust in governments and satisfaction with the way democracies work has been declining. They see more democracy across the world but less governance. They attribute much of the rising public disaffection to unfulfilled expectations and aspirations. Disruptions caused by technological change and globalisation have undermined the effectiveness of governments to deliver the policies needed for sustained economic growth. What they call the Great Disruption has produced anger and fear. “People hurt by social and economic changes and lack of public delivery get angry and react against the rulers and the rules when their expectations are not met.”\nWhether practicable or not, the authors’ recipe for effective governance is “democracy at multiple levels” with “reallocation of power at local, national, continental and global levels with innovative combinations of direct democracy, representative government and rule by experts”.\nA key factor that emerges in the discussion of trust is the negative impact of political polarisation prevailing in countries — in both East and West — on the public’s view of leaders and governments. This has rightly been seen to cause waning public confidence in political institutions and those in charge of them. This should strike a familiar note in Pakistan and is directly relevant to the present state of play in the country. With political polarisation reaching a record level and the government and opposition locked in unremitting confrontation this cannot but affect the public’s opinion of their leaders especially at a time when their focus should be on the challenges facing the country. The lesson from the ongoing power struggle is that both sides can end up losing the trust of the people they seek to serve."}]}

The decisions that followed thePDM’s Lahore rallyand the atmosphere its combative campaign has created can be consequential in the days to come. The confrontation between the government and opposition continues to polarise the country and reinforce a fraught environment. Both sides have ruled out any dialogue and remain at loggerheads with each other. The opposition’s tough rhetoric has been matched by the government’s aggressive verbal response.\nAs widely anticipated, the opposition gave the prime minister adeadline— Jan 31 — to either step down or face a march on the capital. While it avoided setting any dates for both the threatened resignations from parliamentary membership and the ‘long march’, the opposition pledged to continue mounting pressure on the government. Meanwhile, opposition legislators have been asked to submit resignations from the assemblies to their parties.\nDespite the unity signalled by the opposition’s Lahore Declaration, there are conflicting views among its leaders about when and how to escalate pressure on the government. This is not surprising for a disparate alliance cobbled together for varying motives. Nevertheless, differences among hardliners and those who prefer a more measured approach pose a challenge for the PDM. Can it maintain a unified strategy going forward? Some constituent parties are not too convinced that the resignation card — which PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari calls the nuclear option — should be played too soon. After all, the PPP would have the most to lose — control of the Sindh government — if it went ahead with resignations without any guarantee that this action would lead to fresh elections.\nSustaining a unified approach on strategy and tactics in what will likely be a long haul and also ensure its public campaign doesn’t run out of steam will test the PDM in the months ahead. Whether its plans for political activities in the coming weeks will help to maintain the opposition’s momentum is yet to be seen.\nUncertainty lies ahead for both sides with no assurance that their strategies will deliver the outcome they want.\nThe opposition will also confront other dilemmas. It must know that even if it is able to forge an agreed strategy and act as a cohesive coalition, there is hardly any surety that it will achieve its principal objective of forcing the Imran Khan government from power. The country’s past history of ‘long marches’ and their outcomes is before them. As also is the reality that the decisive factor remains the establishment’s position. Marches on the capital do not ipso facto trigger the fall of any government.\nAs for mass resignations from legislatures, even if this comes to pass, again there is no certainty that it would compel the government to call new elections. Government spokesmen have repeatedly said they will defeat the opposition plan by holding by-elections to seats that are surrendered even if that means they are held in phases and not all at once — a difficult logistical exercise in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis. Therefore, opposition brinkmanship is by no means a strategy that will yield the result its leaders hope for.\nNone of this means the government doesn’t also face dilemmas. The threat of agitation and resignations does present a challenge that the government will need to manage in a way that averts any political upheaval that can snowball into a crisis. Also, the negative impact of political turbulence on the economy can be significant, especially at a time when economic hardship — some but not all driven by the pandemic — has been causing rising public discontent with the government. Already, the limits of the government’s administrative abilities have been laid bare by the food price spiral and the LNG issue.\nOn resignations, the government’s stance may be too complacent as it minimises the risk that this could lead to turmoil that Islamabad may be ill-equipped to handle. Denialism is no strategy. In fact, the government’s response in the face of opposition pressure so far lacks clarity. Instead, multiple pressers by its spokespersons have shown that the government has come under pressure from the opposition’s actions.\nThe government has also stirred a controversy by its proposal for voting in the Senate election to take place by a show of hands and not secret ballot. This will likely need a constitutional amendment even though the government believes otherwise and is seeking the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion in this regard. The government has also announced its intention to hold the Senate election a month ahead of schedule, authority for which rests with the Election Commission. Predictably, these announcements have evoked criticism from PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz as well as PPP and other PDM leaders.\nThe government’s biggest dilemmas may be of its own making. With the opposition aiming to make Punjab the political battleground, it is inexplicable why the PTI leadership continues with a lacklustre and weak provincial government that has shown little ability to handle the opposition’s assault. Its stultifying management of the province has already contributed to the party losing significant political ground there. Again, denialism — the pretence that the arrangement is delivering — is magnifying the government’s challenge. Indeed, competent governance in Punjab would go a long way to strengthen the PTI government’s hands at the centre as well as manage the opposition — a fact acknowledged privately by senior party members. But the leadership’s disconnect with reality on this count is only adding another dimension to the government’s challenges and hobbling its response to the PDM.\nWhat lies ahead for both sides is uncertainty and no assurance that their respective strategies will deliver the outcome they want. For both the path ahead is fraught with difficulty. Meanwhile, the country will continue to bear the brunt of the intensifying confrontation between the government and the opposition. Some voices from both sides want to keep the door open for dialogue, but for now these are all but drowned out by the no-talks posture of their leaderships. This means that prospects for political stability remain clouded in unpredictability, leaving the country once again on the edge of a preventable crisis."}]}

The year of the pandemic disrupted lives everywhere and tested people’s endurance and resilience. As elsewhere, Pakistan too plunged into unmapped territory.\nThe government faced the biggest test of its tenure as its handling of Covid-19 was consequential to the evolving crisis. Initial management laid bare a vacillating approach as the government struggled to choose between prioritising lives or livelihoods. Of course, leaders across the world sought to find a balance between the two. But as many agreed, this was a false choice, because saving lives was necessary to save livelihoods.\nIn Pakistan the government’s early messaging and actions left its policy approach unclear and incoherent. Mixed signals from the leadership did not initially convey the urgency or severity of the unfolding threat. Procrastination over social distancing measures and getting mired in a prolonged public debate about lockdown vs no lockdown, also conveyed indecisiveness.\nThe prime minister’s tone changed when the number of cases rose. Yet weeks into the crisis centre-province coordination was found wanting. The prime minister’s reluctance to reach out to provincial leaderships, especially of Sindh, prevented a unified policy from emerging. This continued until a National Command and Operation Centre was established. It was only after the NCOC took charge, with the army’s help, that crisis management became more coherent. Even then premature self-congratulation by the government encouraged complacency when the virus was to wreak more havoc in its second wave — which continues. The opposition, for its part, showed little responsibility during the second surge, persisting with mass rallies despite the danger of contagion.\nThe government’s performance on the domestic front will determine its political fortunes in 2021.\nThe government’s stimulus packages and the enhanced Ehsaas programme were important steps to mitigate the pandemic’s economic fallout. Protecting the vulnerable by Ehsaas emergency cash handouts of Rs159 billion, which benefited 15 million families, was widely appreciated. Overall economic management sought to soften the blows delivered by the pandemic. Official estimates put economic losses at Rs3 trillion. The macroeconomic situation improved in the second half of 2020 but major challenges remained unaddressed especially with debt and liabilities building up, revenue shrinking and inflation soaring. Losses of state-owned enterprises and the power sector’s circular debt continued to mount pressure on the budget. Negotiations stalled with the IMF. With growth projected at below one per cent by the World Bank in the current fiscal year this will gravely undermine efforts at job creation and poverty alleviation.\nThe other big issue dominating 2020 was the raging confrontation between the government and opposition and deepening polarisation. The PTI government made no effort to engage the opposition in a dialogue on pressing national issues, insisting that the opposition only wanted to talk about an NRO. The opposition vehemently denied this but questioned the one-sidedness of the accountability process.\nWhen 11 opposition parties coalesced into an alliance — PDM — confrontation entered a new phase. Both sides adopted uncompromising positions. After a series of public rallies, the PDM unveiled its strategy for the year ahead. It called on the prime minister to either step down by Jan 31 or face a march on the capital. It threatened mass resignations from the assemblies but stopped short of setting a deadline except to ask MPs to submit resignations to their parties.\nIf the government responded in a schizophrenic way — rattled by the opposition’s aggressiveness yet complacent about the impact of mass resignations — the opposition confronted its own challenge of maintaining unity among differences over the value and timing of resignations. Inevitably the stand-off between the two deflected focus from internal and external challenges especially at a time when India intensified its belligerent posture against Pakistan. National cohesion in the face of external challenges remained conspicuous by its absence in 2020.\nGovernance too remained patchy at best. PTI leaders no longer had the excuse of being new to the job, as acknowledged recently by the prime minister himself. The government continued to over-promise and under-deliver on most fronts. Nowhere was the government’s weak governance more evident than in Punjab with a team there that lacked competence and gravitas to the discomfort of senior party figures who urged privately — in vain — for a change of guard.\nThe government demonstrated a mixed record on foreign policy. Its two principal preoccupations during 2020 remained tensions with India following its illegal and brutal actions in occupied Kashmir and escalation on the Line of Control as well as the fast-evolving situation in Afghanistan. The former presented a grim prospect while the latter marked a moment of hope and opportunity. Relations with India sunk to a new low with all meaningful diplomatic engagement suspended. The government’s Kashmir campaign lacked consistency and imagination especially seen against its aim of raising the diplomatic costs for India of its Kashmir actions. This made efforts to mobilise international support far more imposing in the coming year.\nDevelopments in Afghanistan offered the promise of peace. Pakistan played an active and important role in the events leading up to the February Doha accord between the US and Taliban and the start of intra-Afghan negotiations. But the path to a negotiated settlement remained strewn with obstacles, which left Islamabad with having to prepare for less hopeful scenarios. It was unclear whether the government started work on this.\nRelations with China continued on a robust, positive trajectory. With the US, the main commonality remained Afghanistan. The advent of the Biden administration however opened up the opportunity to rebuild ties and impart content to the bilateral relationship, which has been elusive in recent years.\nSignificant was the downturn in ties with Saudi Arabia despite official protestations to the contrary. That Islamabad was asked to repay a substantial part of a loan was testimony to this as also the apparent freezing of an oil credit facility. The absence of high-level engagement between the two key allies also confirmed this.\nThe lack of any foreign policy direction in the outgoing year reflected the dearth of imagination that generally afflicts the government. However, it will be the government’s performance on the domestic front that will matter more and determine its fortunes in 2021."}]}

Ensure the article presents a nuanced perspective on the subject, incorporates geopolitical insights, and maintains a formal, insightful tone."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "THE political culture of a country always evolves. But not necessarily in a positive direction. As elsewhere in the world, politics in Pakistan has long had unseemly dimensions. Political leaders have often acted from a zero-sum view of political competition and were far from respectful of their opponents.\nHowever, the political culture in the country today is a departure from the past in many respects. Even if some features were present earlier, they were not as dominant as they are now. Today both the language used by political leaders and their conduct have fostered an environment that is permeated by such extreme positions and incendiary rhetoric as to render any meaningful political conversation impossible. Rarely has the public discourse sunk to the low level that it has now. True that past political behaviour also exhibited some of these traits. But it is their pronounced nature and the angry environment that politicians are playing off and reinforcing as well as using multiple media platforms for aggressive messaging that distinguishes the present.\nFour overlapping aspects of the ‘new’ political culture stand out: the language of politics has taken on a form and tone that is excessively harsh; the accent by politicians is on demonising opponents rather than articulating their own positions; the political middle ground is being steadily eliminated; and the ethic of war has been injected into politics by an attitude that sees opponents as enemies to be eliminated rather than competed with.\nThe impact of the confluence of these factors has been to create a toxic political environment that is sharply polarised and dominated by invective, not argument. Insults are routinely hurled by government and opposition figures against each other. Polemics by both sides have assumed an intensely personal nature, involving character attacks. Extreme partisanship has also made the political centre-ground disappear with little effort directed at bridging differences.\nThis has debased the political discourse, diminished the middle ground and eroded public trust in leaders.\nPolitical leaders spend more time vilifying the other than conveying what they stand for and how they propose to address the country’s challenges. Those in power seem to equate government performance with humiliating rivals while opposition leaders return the compliment by using equally offensive language. This has become habit forming. The result is that an unedifying new normal has been established.\nA number of factors might help to explain what has contributed to this new normal in Pakistan’s political culture. First and foremost, political parties no longer seem to represent any set of ideas or have coherent programmes — except as platitudes. The lack of distinct party platforms has in fact fostered a phase of issueless politics and personalised power struggles. There is no debate on ideas or policy alternatives. This makes the resort to shallow and provocative rhetoric an easy option and becomes the political weapon of choice.\nIt can be argued that the rise of a new political force, PTI, has also contributed to a more combative political culture by leaders who used language and engaged in conduct that upended traditional political norms. This became its way of challenging the political status quo, which it had no ability to do in any substantive sense. The point is that once established norms are discarded, that infects the whole body politic and contagion spreads across all parties who adopt the same language and behaviour. This is what seems to have happened.\nOther factors are also important in understanding this change in political culture. The proliferation of the broadcast and social media has in recent years made numerous information platforms available to leaders and their followers to communicate and direct polemics against opponents. The era of the print media (when TV was a government monopoly) imposed sharp limits on what was fit to print and thus inhibited most vitriol from being uttered and published. By its very nature the independent broadcast media did away with these constraints and encouraged a no holds barred discourse. Talk shows provided adversarial settings, accentuated polarised debate and preferred heat over light in exchanges between public representatives.\nThe explosion of social media exacerbated this trend as intemperate language could be used without consequence or retribution. It made it easier for political leaders and activists to say what they wanted, with no check on the propriety or veracity of their assertions.\nAnother factor that might explain the changing political culture is rising anger in society. This has been the consequence, over time, of rising but dashed public expectations and frustration with the inability of successive governments to meet their demands and aspirations. In confronting this growing anger leaders and parties have increasingly struck a severe tone to channel this public sentiment while strengthening it further. At times it seemed as if political leaders by speaking in harsher tones saw this as their principal way of assuaging an angry public.\nWhat then are the consequences of this kind of change in the country’s political culture? For a start it has debased the public discourse and detracted from meaningful or informed discussion of the country’s challenges, much less generated solutions to its problems. If most of the political conversation consists of invective, diatribes and allegations of malfeasance and venality against one another it denudes the political system of the ability to conduct reasoned debate on issues. Most significantly, it has shrunk the space for compromise, which is so essential to build consensus to make the democratic system work smoothly and effectively.\nA polarised environment marked by constant exchange of tough rhetoric is hardly conducive to evolving consensus on key national issues. It has also sucked oxygen from the government to engage in a sustained manner in serious, policy-focused activity. This distraction and the lack of political consensus have ended up making governance more difficult.\nBut it also risks undermining the democratic system by generating public cynicism about constantly squabbling leaders and their immoderate conduct. This not only erodes public trust but can also mire the country’s institutions in controversy as they become the centre of attack by politicians themselves. Moreover, if political institutions are rendered dysfunctional by political leaders’ own actions this can end up delegitimising them. The big loser in all of this will inevitably be Pakistan’s fragile democracy."}]}

They usually offer a big picture view of trends as well as global risks.\nThere is little doubt that the coronavirus pandemic that dominated 2020 will continue to be the overwhelming challenge across the world. Managing its economic fallout will preoccupy and test governments everywhere. Several dynamics are in play at the start of the year — another surge in Covid-19 cases in many countries and rollout of vaccines that offers the promise of eventually ending the pandemic. But mass inoculation will take time while vaccine distribution will be uneven with richer countries having greater access to supplies while poorer states will have to wait.\nWHO officials have repeatedly urged that the vaccine be equitably shared. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has made similar entreaties saying vaccines should be viewed as a ‘global public good’. Despite such calls to make vaccines available to people everywhere, ‘vaccine nationalism’ will be more in play in 2021. Tom Standage, editor of The Economist’s ‘World in 2021’, named this as the year’s top trend, predicting “fights over vaccines…within and between countries over who should get them and when”.\nA striking aspect of the pandemic has been the lack of international solidarity that was needed to deal with the common challenge. While global cooperation is essential to negotiate the pandemic’s economic and social consequences, will the trend continue of countries turning inwards and acting on their own? “Insularity” is posited as the defining feature of 2021 by Geopolitical Futures’ (GPF) annual forecast, with countries “consumed” by their own problems. The annual survey of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) describes this trend in a wider sense, as not only anational approach to the pandemic, but also a national impulse in geopolitics. It sees “strategic self-determination” driving more efforts by states to “develop their own strategic identity rather than have this shaped for them by regional or institutional affiliations.”\nThe year will present both risks & opportunities at a time when global leadership will be in short supply.\nThis raises the much-debated question about the future of multilateralism at a time of growing multipolarity. The retreat from multilateralism emerged as a dominant trend in the last decade with the rise of hyper nationalism and right-wing populism. Major powers and regional ‘strongmen’ have been pursuing unilateralist policies in defiance of international law, which has eroded a rules-based international order. The advent of the Biden administration in the US has however raised hopes that the trend away from multilateral cooperation will be gradually reversed. President-elect Biden has already declared his intention to rejoin the Paris Climate agreement, return to WHO and re-enter the Iran nuclear deal. 2021 will certainly offer an opportunity to strengthen multilateralism although Stratfor’s 2021 Forecast sees a “constrained return to multilateralism” by Biden.\nMost assessments agree that the greatest geopolitical risk of 2021 concerns relations between two global powers, the US and China — the world’s most pivotal relationship with global impact. Some see Biden trying to mend ties with China while others predict intensifying tensions between them. The US-based Atlantic Council says relations could reach a denouement over Taiwan. GPF predicts a freeze in relations. Still others think the relationship will stabilise. It may not be as “overtly confrontational” as it was under President Trump according to the Eurasia Group’s report on Top Risks for 2021. This asserts that “both sides will seek some breathing space”. But it also says that the desire for stability will be offset by other factors to rule out détente. Many assessments suggest an intensification of both trade tensions and the tech war.The Economistreport says that fragmentation of the digital world and its supply chain into two parts, “one Chinese-dominated and the other American-led”, will continue. The IISS survey also cites the prospect of “digital spheres of influence.”\nMany Western analysts see a fundamental difference between Trump and Biden in engaging allies to pursue the competition with China.The Economistargues that Biden will seek cooperative ties with allies to “more effectively” wage the trade war with Beijing. Most annual reports however failed to anticipate the diplomatic skill and speed with which China has moved to forge deals with US allies — an investment treaty with the EU and a trade deal (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) with 14 Asia-Pacific states. This has begun to limit US options to enlist allies in this regard and has been described as a “strategic win” for China byThe Financial Times.\nEconomic recovery will be the main preoccupation for all countries in 2021. Varied prospects are forecast for a global financial rebound from the impact of the pandemic. There seems agreement that this will be patchy as the virus will take time to contain and continue to induce a deep recession and job losses. Developing countries will face tougher challenges. Despite some debt relief initiatives by richer states, debt liabilities have risen to record levels for them. The World Bank forecasts that millions more will be pushed into extreme poverty. Contraction in growth will greatly inhibit job creation and set back poverty alleviation efforts in developing countries. The overall outlook is for an increase in inequality within and between nations. This obviously has implications for social stability.\nThe IMF in its outlook says the crisis is likely to leave “deep and unequal scars” with “uncertainty and risks exceptionally high”. Financial market turbulence can be expected to continue for much of 2021. The speed and extent of recovery in countries will depend on several factors especially on how effectively they get the virus under control and effects of their economic stimulus policies. Only China’s economic growth is expected to be robust.\nAlthough many other risks are identified by several annual assessments, the one that finds common emphasis is cyber security. This will continue to loom large as a concern for governments and businesses. The Eurasia report calls 2021 “the year that cyber conflict will create unprecedented technological and geopolitical risk”.\nThus 2021 will present both risks and opportunities but at a time when global leadership will continue to be in short supply."}]}

The storming of the US Capitol on Jan 6 shook the country and shocked the world. A president who refused to accept the election results, declined to cooperate in the transfer of power and incited a violent mob to attack Congress — all pushed the country to the edge. This was followed by the historic impeachment of Donald Trump on the charge of “incitement of insurrection”.\nThe invasion of the Capitol was just the latest demonstration of the outrageous behaviour long associated with Trump. Taken to dangerous limits in his presidency’s final days it plunged the country into crisis. The effort by a rampaging horde to disrupt and prevent Congress from certifying the election result failed. But it left the country reeling from the attack described by US commentators as America’s “day of infamy”.\nThere are two ways of looking at the horrific events that led to the impeachment. As a failed ‘coup’ attempt that has created the opportunity for reassertion of the political middle ground and restoration of sanity and stability. Trump’s own goal left him and his supporters defeated and diminished. Had he not orchestrated this assault he would not be leaving the White House much weaker and impeached for a second time by the House of Representatives, a unique distinction. Many companies have axed campaign donations to him and cut business ties.\nAn alternative perspective is that last week’s events reflect the grim realities of a fractured country that will not easily disappear with Joe Biden’s assumption of the presidency. The political chasm that led to the violent siege has long been in evidence and reinforced by the election. The setback to the far right may just be a setback, not a terminal state. The alarming developments also exposed the sharp divide between senior Republicans and rank and file lawmakers of the party. In the impeachment vote 197 Republican Congressmen — an overwhelming majority — voted against the motion. Earlier, 147 Republican members of the House voted against certifying the election result even after the mob attack on the Capitol. These realities will continue to shape American politics and not fade away with the president’s inauguration.\nGovernance will be tough for Biden if Trump’s grip over the Republican party continues.\nThis will make governance more difficult for President Biden even though he starts with the crucial advantage of his party controlling both the Senate and the House. But his pledge to heal and unite a deeply divided country won’t be easy. Efforts at unifying the country also have to address racial tensions that have been erupting. These challenges have to be met when the pandemic is continuing to rage and wreak havoc on the country. This will be the first order of business for his administration. But it too will need national consensus and bipartisan cooperation.\nBiden’s effort to stabilise the country will depend in large part on Trump’s political future, other than on containing the virus and ensuring an economic recovery. Despite Trump’s impeachment by the House, the Senate is unlikely to convict him given its composition. His future may largely depend on whether the Republican party severs the grip he has on the party. Its senior leadership in the Senate denounced the Capitol assault and rejected Trump’s narrative of a stolen election. A few Republican congressmen also voted for his impeachment.\nParty moderates may now see Trump as a dangerous liability who has deprived them of the White House and Senate and who now stands impeached, though not yet debarred from holding office. But that is not necessarily the case for grassroots activists, his political base, and many Republican congressmen.\nThe question is whether senior Republican leaders will be able to withstand pressure from the rank and file, many of whom buy the falsehood that Trump was cheated of election victory. Right-wing political forces may be down but not necessarily out. White supremacist groups that Trump emboldened over the years have drawn oxygen from the recent attack and subsequent developments seeing them as an effort by the ‘deep state’ to thwart Trump.\nThe political calculus of the Democrats for the impeachment move was not just to hold Trump guilty of causing an insurrection and uphold the law but to write his political obituary and divide the Republican party so that the majority would disown him. It is yet to be seen if Republicans can reclaim the radicalised ‘party of Trump’. As Jennifer Rubin recently wrote in The Washington Post, “A shocking number of Republicans remain under Trump’s spell”.\nPolitical turbulence therefore remains a real possibility especially as far-right violence is now part of the American political landscape. Fringe extremist groups that were mainstreamed and emboldened by Trump will continue to be a threat to stability. This is also signified by warnings of US security agencies during the Trump administration that armed white supremacist groups are among the most lethal threats to the country. In congressional testimony last October, the FBI director revealed that “racially motivated violent extremism,” principally from white supremacists, represented “the majority of domestic terrorism threats”.\nThe FBI has warned of violent protests across the country leading up to the inauguration and even beyond. Washington is on high alert with thousands of law-enforcement personnel deployed amid fears that extremist groups may plan violence on inauguration day.\nAs if this political crisis and troubled domestic legacy was not a formidable enough challenge the risk of more turmoil in a polarised environment makes Biden’s task even tougher. This will also complicate his effort to mend the immeasurable damage done to America’s global reputation. The assault on the Capitol and the impeachment drama have dealt a big blow to the international standing and image of the US. This has come on the back of policies pursued by Trump of unilateralism and disregard for international norms. These drained America’s soft power and tarnished its reputation.\nThus, America’s political crisis may not end with a new occupant in the White House. With the country at a crossroads politics may enter another phase of uncertainty, even unrest. After all, Trumpism remains firmly embedded in American society even with Trump gone. Washington’s Democratic mayor Muriel Bowser put it starkly: “Trumpism won’t die on January 20.”"}]}

His government has a window of opportunity to take initiatives and focus on governance rather than the opposition. This will also demonstrate that it has gone past the phase of its unifocal preoccupation with the opposition.\nWhile PDM has continued efforts to mount political pressure it has been unable to force a crisis to challenge the PTI government or warrant its full-time attention. This means the government has the chance to get down to serious business and set, as well as, elaborate its agenda for the year ahead.\nAmong the steps it might consider are: 1) engage more actively at the leadership level in managing the pandemic and laying out the vaccination plan; 2) recast the cabinet and its team in Punjab; 3) reach out to the business community to encourage investment and boost productivity and growth; 4) plan for comprehensive civil service reform; 5) undertake a wide-ranging review of foreign policy.\nAlthough the Covid-19 situation is not as alarming as it is in other countries, including in the neighbourhood, this is no reason to be sanguine about the future. Especially so because examples from elsewhere show that cases surge when complacency or fatigue sets in, or when new variants enter the country. A hands-on approach by the leadership is needed in a number of areas: robust public messaging (virtually absent now), increased testing, as well as ensuring SOP compliance by businesses/ markets/ educational institutions. Above all, the government must ensure that procurement of vaccines is swiftly done. It is already behind the curve on this count. There is little clarity about which vaccines will be secured given the global challenge of unequal access with richer countries monopolising initial supplies. Yet to be explained is how vaccines will be rolled out across the country. The Pakistan Medical Association has also asked for clarification and criticised the government for lack of plans to vaccinate people. The prime minister should himself lay out the national vaccination plan as this is obviously the only way to exit from the pandemic.\nThe government has political space to take initiatives and shift its attention to governance from the opposition.\nMid-term is also an appropriate time for the government to reconfigure its team. The prime minister has frequently voiced dissatisfaction with the working of several ministries. But this has rarely been followed by corrective action. Shuffling a minister or two doesn’t inject new vigour into a team that looks jaded and is tellingly short on competence. A lean and effective team that has political gravitas will in fact help steer the party to the next election. The cabinet needs to inspire public confidence by showing an ability to deliver, not just engage in political invective against opponents.\nThe leadership in Punjab remains the government’s weakest point and has shown little capacity to develop the political and governing skills needed to run the country’s largest province. Consequently, PTI has lost political ground here and is increasingly out of sync with its own urban middle-class constituency which feels under-represented by the provincial leadership.\nThe macroeconomic challenge has been managed reasonably well in the face of economic blows delivered by the pandemic. But this is a necessary, not sufficient, condition for economic recovery. A key microeconomic policy step would be to ease the cost of doing business by tackling the regulatory burden that is impeding productivity and efficiency, and hindering investment and growth — so essential to deal with debt liabilities. The government should reach out to the business community to evolve a longer-term strategy to promote productivity, trade and investment. Rather than convene large meetings it should engage with specific industry groups and determine how to encourage investment. Without a significant increase in investment, economic growth, forecast at less than one per cent in the current fiscal year, will not take off even when the pandemic is under control. With debt building up this will constrain the government’s ability to address rising unemployment.\nThe government should move decisively, after necessary consultation with stakeholders, to implement institutional reform to make the civil service fit for purpose and people-friendly. The recent official announcement that ‘reforms’ have been approved by the prime minister entail proposed changes which barely go beyond efficiency and discipline rules and conversion of existing promotion policy into promotion rules. They fall way short of comprehensive civil service reform. Piecemeal changes can in fact cause confusion and be counterproductive.\nThe elements of comprehensive reform are well known: depoliticisation to ensure merit in postings and transfers, fundamental changes in training and recruitment to promote understanding of the complex nature of modern governance and encourage specialisation and technological know-how, reverse falling standards, incentivise performance, set out measurable deliverables, strictly implement rotation policy, weed out poor performers by severance packages and consider only the most competent for the highest grades. Regulatory agencies including Nepra, Ogra and Pemra also need to be restructured along modern lines.\nAnother key policy area that merits immediate attention is Pakistan’s external engagements. A wide-ranging foreign policy review is necessary to adjust to sweeping changes taking place in the world and in our region. At a time when the global environment and geopolitical shifts offer both challenges and opportunities it is essential that our foreign policy goals are placed in this wider context and diplomatic initiatives framed to leverage or respond to them. Often relations with specific countries are dealt with in silos and tend to be reactive and ad hoc rather than strategically thought through. That is a why a broad review is important. The government has not undertaken such a review since it assumed power. Occasional briefings to the prime minister on key relationships are obviously not the same thing as for him to preside over a review of the whole gamut of foreign policy with inputs from Pakistan’s Missions across the world.\nBy moving on these multiple fronts in a coherent and consensual manner the government may be able to dispel the widespread public impression that it is only muddling through and has a ­single-issue fixation — the opposition."}]}

Top officials of the Biden administration haveannouncedthat they would review the February 2020 agreement forged between the US and Taliban in Doha a year ago.\nEarlier this month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Congress during his confirmation hearing that the administration would “have to look carefully at what has been negotiated to understand fully what commitments were made by the Taliban and to see where they get with their negotiations with the government of Afghanistan”. He also made it plain that Washington wanted to “end this so-called forever war” and “bring forces home”. And he added that the US may want to “retain some capacity to deal with any resurgence of terrorism”.\nUS National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan reiterated the same message during a call to his Afghan counterpart Hamdullah Mohib. He was cited as saying he “made clear the United States’ intention to review” the (Doha) deal and check whether the Taliban are “living up to [their] commitments to cut ties with terrorist groups, reduce violence in Afghanistan, and engage in meaningful negotiations with the Afghan government and other stakeholders”. In quick response, a Taliban spokesman declared they would “honour the agreement” and expect “the other side to remain committed to their agreement too”.\nNone of this is a surprise. Any incoming administration can be expected to examine afresh agreements made by its predecessor. But what will this mean for efforts to find a negotiated end to Afghanistan’s long war? And for withdrawal of the remaining 2,500 US forces, pledged for May 2021 under the Doha deal, in exchange for Taliban guarantees to prevent Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups from operating in Afghanistan. Firm answers to these questions will only emerge once the review is concluded.\nThe US may shift the May timeline of its withdrawal to ensure the Taliban’s compliance with commitments.\nThere are however pointers to the direction the review might take. President Joe Biden has long been averse to prolonged US military engagement in Afghanistan. As vice president he opposed the military surge president Obama ordered in 2009 and urged a narrow definition of US interests focused on counterterrorism. He advocated an end to “forever wars” often invoking the Vietnam experience to support his stance.\nThese views and the fact that the US troop pullout is now so far down the road suggests that the Biden administration is unlikely to reverse or significantly change course from what has been agreed under the Doha accord, which is in its interest to affirm. The political context too is significant given public fatigue with a long, unwinnable war. During the year since the agreement was signed there has been no American casualty in Afghanistan with the Taliban adhering to their commitment not to attack US/Nato forces. Any policy change that risks the loss of US lives is not a likely option, the political cost of which will be high. Another indication of policy continuity is the decision announced by Blinken in his first press conference to retain special representative Zalmay Khalilzad, apparently till May.\nSome policy clarity may emerge from Washington before a Nato defence ministers meeting scheduled for Feb 18 in Brussels with Afghanistan on the agenda, even though the review would take longer. Europeans have been sceptical about a total troop withdrawal in May given intensifying violence in Afghanistan. That may influence the review. Biden has in the past argued for retaining a small counterterrorism force in Afghanistan, a view Blinken echoed in his congressional testimony. But it is questionable whether this can be negotiated with the Taliban, who are unlikely to agree to any kind of residual force in Afghanistan. This could be a deal breaker and may lead to the collapse of the Doha accord — an outcome that will make the presence of international forces unsustainable and put the peace process at risk.\nWhile the Afghan policy review may not add new US conditions (as some in the Afghan government hope) indications are that the Biden team will want existing conditions to be effectively met and insist on implementation of all aspects of the Doha agreement. As Barnett Rubin (former special adviser at the State Department) told me: “In deciding on how best to implement the agreement, the US is likely to follow the provision of the agreement stating that all of its components are ‘inter-related’.” According to him, the Biden administration “will focus on comprehensive implementation of the Doha agreement to ensure a safe US withdrawal but also engage in robust regional diplomacy to back that up”.\nThe Biden administration is widely expected to reaffirm the framework of the Doha agreement. But there is every possibility that it will push the Taliban much harder to ensure they are, as a US National Security Council spokesperson put it, “living up to their commitments to cut ties with terrorist groups, reduce violence in Afghanistan, and engage in meaningful negotiations with the Afghan government and other stakeholders”. A Pentagon spokesman said as much but added that Washington remains committed to the agreement. A more serious US effort is also likely aimed at eliciting Taliban assurances that women’s rights and human rights are protected and respected.\nIn order to secure compliance with these commitments Washington may shift the May timeframe of its final withdrawal making it contingent on comprehensive implementation of the Doha agreement, especially reduction of violence and real progress in intra-Afghan talks. How the Taliban will react to a delayed pullout is an open question.\nAs a key stakeholder Pakistan should engage early with the Biden administration to convey its views so that the review takes them into account. Islamabad is looking to Washington to reaffirm the Doha agreement and believes that it offers the best and perhaps only chance for a negotiated peace. This warrants active US backing for the peace talks and pressing both, not just one of the parties, towards a settlement. But if the US decides to delay the deadline for its withdrawal it will need much effort to prevent the peace process from unravelling."}]}

These statements warrant comment as the prime minister isn’t alone in holding these views. Other people also subscribe to this opinion.\nThe prime minister said that the people of Pakistan should not be concerned about creating a ‘soft image’ of the country only to please outsiders, specifically the West. He asked a rhetorical question: what does a ‘soft image’ really mean? Will creating such an image mean the “world will consider us as very good?” This, he argued, only reflects an inferiority complex and the mark of people who lack self-confidence. Only an independent and confident nation commands the respect of others.\nThe prime minister is right that an image should not be manufactured merely to please others. That would never work as any hollow characterisation bereft of reality will lack credibility. There can also be no disagreement with his assertion that national confidence comes from “standing on one own’s feet” and not relying on aid or borrowing from outside. However, the projection of a ‘soft image’ that he regards as futile seems to be based on a misunderstanding and is at odds with what he has said at other times. He has often stated how tourism and Pakistan’s scenic beauty can help to promote the country’s image and attract more visitors. Also, at the same launch event he lamented how PTV dramas no longer attract overseas audiences as they once did, which again contradicts the view that the country’s image is of little significance.\nSoft power efforts are imperative for Pakistan to correct misperceptions and project its many positive attributes.\nThe expression ‘soft image’ is often used in Pakistan but without any real understanding of what it means or encompasses. There is even less awareness about what ‘soft power’ is, what constitutes it and why countries, big and small, deploy it to advance their goals in the world. Put simply, a positive image of a country reflects and generates soft power.\nThe image of a country obviously derives from its various attributes — society, culture, values, economy and politics. Every country has strengths and weaknesses. Emphasising the positive aspects of a country is not about pleasing others or being defensive. In fact, not doing so allows rivals or adversaries to define you and seize the narrative, to the country’s detriment.\nTurning to the concept of soft power, its greater importance today is a consequence of our changing times. In a world fundamentally transformed by technological and scientific advances as well as the information revolution the nature of power has also been changing. Widely accepted is the fact that military and economic power are not the only determinants of a country’s international standing and clout. Nor are they regarded adequate any more to guarantee success in securing foreign policy goals. Increasingly a country’s reputation and positive image count and play a pivotal role in earning respect and enhancing its diplomatic weight in international affairs.\nHarvard scholar Joseph Nye, who introduced the notion of soft power, defined it as the ability to shape the preferences of others and achieve outcomes through “attraction” rather than coercion or economic incentives. He counterposed the soft power of “persuasion and cooption”, to the “power of coercion” represented by the hard power of military and economic strength. And he saw culture, political values and foreign policy as the main sources of soft power.\nOther scholarly studies point out that a range of diverse attributes can comprise soft power resources. They include a country’s governance and human rights record, its educational, scientific and technological prowess, culture and heritage, media and communication, entertainment, tourist attractions, business practices, and of course its foreign policy conduct.\nThe world’s most powerful states, that possess formidable military and economic strength — and ‘stand on their own feet’ — use soft power in their strategies, and spend a great deal of resources on this, not because they lack confidence, but as this helps to magnify their influence and supplement their ‘hard power’. Western countries have long been practising this while China is now investing heavily in soft power projection and making vigorous efforts to win hearts and minds globally.\nBuilding a positive image as part of a soft power strategy is even more important for developing and smaller countries in order to raise their standing and enhance their outreach in a crowded international environment. In an increasingly multipolar and hyperconnected world, power is much more dispersed between and within states. This drives the need to influence a diverse array of actors and many more nations in pursuit of foreign policy goals. Soft power not just aims at influencing policymakers in other countries but also their publics whose opinion can impact on government policy to support a country’s objectives. Similarly, international opinion matters as it creates perceptions about a country that can help or hinder its ability to achieve its foreign policy goals. Thus, soft power efforts are crucial to positively shape perceptions abroad and ensure that a country’s narrative is heard and accepted.\nEndeavours to build a good image and be ‘liked’ in the world enables countries — powerful and not so powerful — to more effectively promote economic (trade and investment) and diplomatic goals (eliciting cooperation to advance core interests). ‘National branding’ represents a key part of these efforts and seeks to convert soft power resources into an identifiable ‘brand’ to attract others. Again, it is a way to engage international attention to promote a country’s economic and commercial interests in competitive global markets.\nFor Pakistan, which has long suffered from international image problems, in part due to mis-characterisations and deliberate distortions and partly because of on-ground realities, it is even more imperative to undertake soft power efforts to ­correct misperceptions, and more importantly, to project its many positive socioeconomic attributes and rich heritage of arts, civilisation and culture. This requires, for a start, official recognition that the endeavour is vital for the pursuit of its national goals and foreign policy interests. It needs, above all, imagination to craft such a strategy and ­incorporate it into its otherwise staid diplomacy."}]}

The political fracas leading up to the Senate election has familiar echoes of the past: chaotic scenes in parliament, hasty action by the ruling party to force a change in the Senate’s voting procedure, and mutual accusations of malintent and malfeasance between the government and opposition which have clouded the substance of the issue.\nThe latest row between the government and opposition has been provoked by the ruling party’s effort for the upcoming Senate election to take place by an open vote and not secret ballot. Predictably, the opposition alliance, PDM, rejected this and accused the government of planning to manipulate the poll scheduled for March 3.\nThe justification for the government’s move is well founded even if its unilateral approach and motive are open to question.\nOne of the country’s worst-kept secrets has been the buying and selling of votes in indirect elections when the electorate is small and therefore easy to manipulate and even corrupt. This was famously evidenced in the past in elections to seats in the National Assembly reserved for Fata and in the Senate polls.\nWith both accusing the other of mala fide intent in the election this can erode the Senate’s legitimacy.\nHorse-trading and buying and selling of votes has a long and inglorious pedigree. Politicians aren’t the only ones who have indulged in this practice. The phenomenon flourished under military governments and at other times when the ubiquitous establishment needed pliant political figures to do their bidding. To ensure their election all sorts of financial blandishments were used. What historian Ayesha Jalal calls the “monetisation of politics and elections” in fact reached a new level under Gen Ziaul Haq in his partyless polls and political system.\nThe case for reform to end such practices is therefore a compelling and long-standing one. However, the way in which the PTI government went about securing the change stoked controversy and the PDM’s opposition. The last-minute and contradictory manner in which it proceeded displayed a sense of desperation, even panic. It moved both to introduce a constitution amendment bill (which was dead on arrival for lack of parliamentary support) and also refer the matter for an advisory opinion to the Supreme Court. Then without waiting for the SC’s decision, a presidential ordinance was promulgated to scrap secret balloting.\nThese actions confused its own party ranks and baffled political observers. Clearly, the manoeuvre was motivated more by a lack of confidence in its own parliamentarians than concern for any high principle of political probity. Cloaked in its vocabulary of righteousness was the fear of its members being tempted by monetary incentives to break rank and vote for non-PTI Senate hopefuls.\nA prudent path for the government would have been to announce its intention well ahead of time and reach out to all parliamentary parties to build consensus. It could have argued that such a change would be win-win for all and not just one party. This is how a parliamentary democracy should work when even political foes, with some effort, evolve a shared interest to agree on a proposed amendment. But a government with a unilateralist mindset was not inclined to take this consensual path. Instead, a quick-fix approach was adopted which became mired in acrimony especially as the government cast the opposition’s resistance as a preference for corrupt practices.\nIn whatever way this eventually plays out, and even if the SC rules in the government’s favour, the episode holds a mirror to the conduct of the country’s political leaders and parties. In the past, almost all major parties advocated the need for reform of Senate practices and spoke out against money being used to manipulate elections. The two main opposition parties, the PML-N and PPP, have been in favour of open balloting for Senate elections. The Charter of Democracy signed by them in 2006 stated explicitly that “To prevent corruption and floor crossing all votes for the Senate and indirect seats will be by open identifiable ballot”.\nA few years ago, the PML-N contemplated parliamentary action to achieve this but failed to make progress because it lacked the necessary numbers for a constitutional amendment. As for the PPP, its leaders declared during the current confrontation that they were not against greater Senate transparency but want this to be part of comprehensive electoral reforms.\nThe opposition should have been smarter to demonstrate its commitment to end electoral malpractices by offering to engage on the issue and insist that a constitutional amendment required a full debate in parliament. This needed time and therefore they were open to such a change provided a consensus was built after open debate. This of course didn’t happen.\nThe point is that in a political culture where expediency takes primacy over principle almost all political parties have acted inconsistently and at odds with their previously stated positions. When it has suited them, they have advocated reform. But when their political adversary appears to be the beneficiary, they have viewed this from zero-sum lens and resisted by employing disingenuous arguments.\nThis conduct raises bigger questions which are consequential for the political system. When political leaders act in ways that is contrary to what they themselves have long been advocating it generates widespread public scepticism. They are then increasingly perceived by the public as believing in nothing except themselves with consistency being sacrificed at the altar of expediency. The more each side accuses the other of engaging in questionable parliamentary practices or trying to protect procedures amenable to corruption, the greater public cynicism about political leaders and the legislature itself. Today, with the government and opposition accusing each other of mala fide intent in the Senate election this does little to enhance the legitimacy of the upper house in popular perception. Political expediency extracts a price — public disillusionment and disenchantment not only with politicians but with the political system, leaving democracy the poorer for it."}]}

A new and insightful book argues that Washington’s long game in the Middle East has similarly been in vain. Titled Losing the Long Game by Philip H. Gordon it critically examines America’s controversial regime change strategy and shows how disastrous it has been.\nAs President Joe Biden crafts his foreign policy the book’s insights offer important lessons from a region that is pivotal not just for Washington but for international peace and security. In his firstforeign policy speechBiden set out broad contours of policy focusing on China, Russia and repairing relationships with traditional allies. He also pledged to re-engage with the international community.\nHowever, the most significant reversal of his predecessor’s policy related to the Middle East. Biden announced an end to American support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen which he depicted as a “humanitarian and strategic catastrophe”. The decision to review some arms sales to Saudi Arabia and recalibrate relations may produce a chill in relations with Riyadh, which Biden criticised on several grounds in recent years. Especially if he makes good on his pledge to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, cavalierly abandoned by president Trump. His administration has formally announced its readiness for talks with Iran but the path to re-entering JCPOA is expected to be arduous and will take time.\nFor Philip Gordon the underlying premise of Trump’s abrogation of this deal was the undeclared policy of regime change in Tehran. Encouraged by hawks in his national security team, Trump expected the Iranian government to be swept away by a popular upheaval due to the tough US policy of sanctions, covert actions, isolation and coercion. That policy failed. But, writes Gordon, it made him think anew about the US track record of regime change efforts over the years “replete with cautionary tales of hubris, overreach and magical thinking”. From the first intervention in Iran in 1953 (“the original sin” of Mosaddeq’s overthrow) to 70 years of clandestine US actions across the Middle East there has been “no case of clear success, some catastrophic failures, and universally high costs and unintended consequences”.\nWhat is laid bare is the folly and failure of Washington’s regime change policy.\nGordon brings his long experience in dealing with the Middle East to a book that narrates a series of failed regional strategies. He served as special coordinator to the Middle East under president Obama and has returned to government as deputy national security adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris. What he calls his direct experience with regime change in the Obama administration informs his views.\nHe dealt with policy to stabilise two countries where the US engineered regime change, Iraq and Afghanistan, and with unsuccessful attempts at political change in Syria, Libya and Egypt. The outcome in Iraq was violence and instability and in Afghanistan, “the Taliban in greater control and a weak and corrupt government in Kabul”.\nThe opening sentence of Gordon’s introduction to the book is telling: “Since the end of World War II the United States has set out to oust governments in the Middle East on an average of once a decade.” These interventions, justified on varied grounds, have been tempting for many administrations but have inevitably gone wrong according to him, “failing badly” in the long run despite deceptive early ‘success’. The lessons he draws from this policy include the following: it is much easier to remove an undesirable regime than to put a better one in its place; the security vacuum that follows engenders bloody power struggles and regional competition; “liberators” invite rejection as money and military force are not enough; and unintended consequences prove to be detrimental.\nThe two chapters on Afghanistan will be of special interest for readers in Pakistan. Their conclusions have added significance as the Biden administration undertakes a review of Afghan policy. Although Biden told the recent Munich conference that he supports the diplomatic process under way to end the war, indications are that Washington may extend the deadline for a complete military pullout from Afghanistan committed under the Doha agreement with the Taliban. That will postpone not reverse the American withdrawal but can risk a collapse of the Doha deal.\nRead:US analyst sees renewed role for Pakistan in Afghan peace deal\nWhile Bob Woodward’s book Obama’s Wars had detailed the heated internal debates that led to the 2009 military surge, which Biden opposed as vice president, Gordon deals with the Afghan conundrum from a longer perspective, from 1979 to the present. He describes Washington’s covert war to roll back the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, how the original goal to “bleed the Russians” and deter further aggression escalated and the deleterious consequences that ensued. He casts this as a pyrrhic victory for the multiple problems it later created for the US and Afghanistan. He does not mention Pakistan in this context and ignores the fact that the country had to struggle for decades to deal with the multifaceted destabilising consequences of that war. However, he cites prime minister Benazir Bhutto telling George Bush during her 1989 visit: “I am afraid we have created a Franken­stein monster that could come to haunt us later.”\nIn the chapter about America’s post-9/11 prosecution of the war in Afghanistan he describes the confusion over US goals, initially, as well as over the next 20 years, under different administrations. He argues that declarations of victory, ‘new approaches’ and rosy assessments by American politicians and generals proved illusory when the situation only continued to deteriorate. His brief account of the Trump policy leading to the Doha accord is informed by the view that the US entered these negotiations from a position of weakness when its intention to pull out had been made apparent. The conclusion he draws from two decades of war is that the US made a “costly mistake” to have tried “to turn Afghanistan into something it had never been before”.\nSome references in these chapters are gratuitously critical of Pakistan — a default option when some Western writers find other explanations inconvenient. Nevertheless, the book is worth reading for its compelling account of the folly of Washington pursuing regime change at the cost of its own long-term interests."}]}

Recent developments have helped to revive the political fortunes of the opposition alliance while the PTI government’s credibility has been shaken and it has been put on the defensive. This however may be transient as dynamics can shift again to advantage the government if it makes the gains it is expecting in the upcoming Senate election and secures control of the upper house. The unopposed election of its Senate candidates from Punjab is an early indication.\nBut for now, the outcome of several by-elections has given a fillip to the opposition with the government showing visible signs of nervousness. Just a few weeks ago PDM seemed to run out of steam, raising questions about whether it could evolve a unified response to mount pressure on the government. Differences between the alliance’s two major parties on how to proceed even generated doubts about PDM’s future.\nThis receded into the background as by-elections to several provincial and National Assembly seats approached, with PML-N and PPP focusing their political energies to winning seats they held before. That they managed to do. Given that by-elections usually swing in the government’s favour, PML-N’s victory in the Nowshera seat — previously held by PTI — marked a significant setback for the ruling party.\nViolenceandcontroversyover ballot fraud in the Sialkot NA by-election delivered a bigger blow to the government’s credibility. PTI leaders claimed to have won in NA-75. But the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) refused to announce the result and casting doubt on election returns from several polling stations ordered an inquiry.\nBeyond PTI’s fault lines the more consequential question is credibility of future elections.\nThen, in another setback to the government, it nullified the result, declaring that the poll had not been held in a “fair and transparent” manner and announced re-election in the entire constituency. The government’s decision to challenge this was not only ill-advised but also exposed its lack of self-confidence.\nAnother blow for the government was ECP’s decision to ask for the suspension and transfer of several district officials and police officers. Observing that chaos spread throughout the constituency, it also summoned the Punjab chief secretary and IGP to explain their dereliction of duty on election day. This was no less than an indictment of the Punjab government. In fact, the entire by-election process exposed the political frailties of both the ruling party and the Punjab government — the latter long regarded even by party members as PTI’s greatest vulnerability. Weak administrations in both Punjab and KP contributed to the disaster in Daska and the unedifying electoral outcome for PTI.\nIn KP, infighting in the ruling party played a key part in its Nowshera defeat which prompted the leadership to remove a provincial minister deemed to have supported the PML-N candidate. When the prime minister later visited Peshawar to rally his party’s lawmakers for the Senate election, 20 PTI MPs absented themselves from the meeting for unexplained reasons.\nMismanagement of the NA-75 by-election can be attributed in most part to an ineffective Punjab leadership that has been unable to govern. Its inability to deal with the run-up to the poll and its chaotic aftermath laid bare its utter lack of competence. Worse, administrative involvement in ballot irregularities — which prompted ECP’s action — lost the party its moral high ground.\nThe political fault lines in the ruling party go beyond this and should be a source of worry for its leadership — as well as cause for correction. Political management has not emerged as a strong suit of a party which lacks political heavyweights with the experience and political acumen to manage an organisation of disparate elements and deal effectively with a motley group of allies, being a coalition government. A political void has also been created by the absence of Jahangir Khan Tareen, who was tasked with party affairs and showed the kind of political savvy, experience and approachability that significantly strengthened PTI.\nContinuing infighting and publicly expressed discontent are testimony to ineffective management of party affairs. This has also been evidenced in the ticketing process for the Senate election. Candidates kept getting shuffled, causing considerable disgruntlement in the party, which also resulted from tickets being awarded to those dubbed as ‘parachuters’. Lack of party discipline is an electoral liability as exemplified by the Nowshera loss and may also be tested in the upcoming Senate poll.\nRifts have been evident in the party’s Balochistan wing over tickets. The party’s parliamentary leader in the provincial assembly, Yar Mohammed Rind, publicly complained about the prime minister’s lack of consultation on election matters, pointing out that his province did not have any representation in the party’s parliamentary board.\nIn the past, reliance on the establishment to help ‘manage’ key parliamentary initiatives and unhappy allies created a disincentive for the leadership to learn and hone the political skills needed for party management. Whether the establishment has now begun to disengage from such activities remains to be determined. What PTI leaders need to acknowledge is that governance is an intensely political task especially in a parliamentary democracy and needs sustained political engagement for the party to function as a cohesive entity and for coalition partners to remain content. If top PTI leaders spend more time engaging with their own parliamentarians than berating the opposition it would strengthen the party and its political base.\nBeyond PTI’s fault lines the bigger and more consequential question concerns the credibility of elections in the future. The country is already haunted by a history of elections that have seen widespread irregularities, voter manipulation and ballot fraud or been challenged by the losing party that has claimed rigging. How then can the integrity of elections be assured in the future so that its results are accepted by all? This is a vexed question with no easy answers in an environment where political leaders see rivals as enemies, not competitors. This inhibits the collaboration needed between them for electoral reform and to accept and play by the rules of the game. But if election outcomes continue to be challenged or marred by voter fraud the very legitimacy of the democratic system will be put at risk."}]}

He has now secured this and demonstrated that he still commands a majority. But this should be a moment of humility and introspection, and not triumphalism. More so because other challenges lie ahead when the political aftershocks of the Senate election, which exposed his government’s fragility, are unlikely to quickly fade away. Therefore, the government needs to reflect on what happened and learn lessons from a bruising experience that forced a trust vote on it.\nThedefeat of the ruling party candidate, Hafeez Sheikh, at the hands of the opposition nominee, Yousuf Raza Gilani, represented one of the biggest upsets in the Senate’s recent election history. Because it became such a high-stake poll, as the entire membership of the National Assembly constitutes the electoral college for Islamabad’s seat, its political impact was that much greater. It left the government reeling from the biggest political setback faced in its tenure. The PTI government was also unable, despite winning more seats, to secure control of the Senate. It has 47 seats along with its coalition partners while PDM and allies have 53.\nThe prime minister sought to blunt the opposition’s demand for a confidence vote in the Assembly by pre-emptively seeking one himself. He secured 178 votes in the open ballot. But here is the paradox. Rather than end political uncertainty and ensure stability this may open the door to more opposition moves in a complex political chess game. The chink in the ruling party’s armour laid bare in the Senate election has emboldened the opposition and encouraged it to mount more pressure and plan further moves.\nThe opposition could now shift the battlefield to Punjab after the prime minister’s successful confidence vote which shrinks the political space for a no-trust motion in the near term. An opposition leader has already hinted at this. The opposition knows that an uninspiring and unpopular leadership in Punjab has made the province PTI’s Achilles heel. The government’s majority is razor thin in the provincial assembly with its survival resting on support from PML-Q, whose leaders have long felt undervalued by the prime minister and could prove to be a wild card in any fluid political situation.\nMore political tests loom for the government which could be consequential.\nMeanwhile, the prime minister’s speech after the Senate election reflected the angst of a leader frustrated by what had happened and who ascribed the setback to the opposition’s “corrupt practices”. The sermonising tone was familiar and repeated in his address to the National Assembly after the trust vote. His gratuitous criticism of the Election Commission for holding the Senate election by secret ballot provoked anunusually sharp rebukefrom the ECP. Yet he echoed the critique in parliament. There was no indication of lessons learnt or any dispassionate assessment of the Senate setback, which is needed in view of the impending election of the Senate chairman.\nFielding Sheikh on a general seat from the capital was not a well-thought decision. As a technocrat he faced a tougher contest when the combined opposition nominated a long-time politician as their candidate. Sheikh had few if any links with Assembly members while Gilani had worked closely with parliamentarians during many decades in politics and as prime minister. Resentment against technocrats being awarded parliamentary seats has long been voiced in PTI. This was to prove consequential.\nThe government did however sense its candidate’s vulnerability and thus made last-minute efforts to secure an open Senate ballot in the hope of forestalling lawmakers from switching sides. All its manoeuvres were however frustrated — the abortive constitution amendment bill, an ordinance and then the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion upholding the secret ballot as enjoined by the Constitution.\nGilani’s victory showed that the government got 11 votes fewer than its parliamentary support while the opposition candidate got five more votes than PDM’s combined National Assembly strength. This meant that members from PTI’s allied parties switched sides and several PTI backbenchers also defied the party line. This was acknowledged by the prime minister himself who later claimed 16 PTI members had “sold out”.\nIt was hardly a surprise. There were signs aplenty of discontent within PTI ranks and among the ruling party’s allies. The chickens had come home to roost for a party leadership that consistently failed to respond to its allies’ concerns and barely found time to address the sources of disgruntlement within PTI. The leader of the House, for example, rarely came to the Assembly.\nAlthough the government will now bask in the success of the confidence vote it would be mistaken to think that its political problems are over. Its experience in the Senate election and earlier in by-elections should be a sobering wake-up call for the leadership and should prompt a rethink of its political management. Legislation will be challenging to steer through parliament as the combined opposition is numerically stronger in the Senate. That should be reason enough for it to abandon its unilateral ways and reach out to work with lawmakers both in and beyond its party.\nThere are other lessons for the government from the Senate setback, which also showed the limits of the establishment’s influence. An important lesson is that political management cannot be left to the establishment. The PTI leadership should focus on addressing its political management deficit and cultivate the habit of listening to its backbenchers and be responsive to allies. Being a coalition government, this should be a matter of priority not choice. It has already seen how losing a few parliamentary votes can yield a negative outcome. With the prime minister generally inaccessible there is no focal person in PTI to whom backbenchers can turn to have their problems addressed.\nIn parliamentary politics nothing can ever be taken for granted. The election of the Senate chairman and deputy chairman is the next political test that looms for the government. But its toughest and most consequential test could come in the Punjab Assembly if the opposition decides to move a no-confidence motion there. That could yet be a game changer."}]}

Political conduct may not have been polite in the past but what is being evidenced now is unprecedented. Daily press conferences by government and opposition representatives involve bitter verbal clashes between them that increasingly assume the form of personal attacks and in language that was the exception rather than norm in the past. Today these verbal duels often involve the use of words hardly appropriate for members of parliament to exchange. Words matter and harsh words have consequences for how politicians are perceived by the public.\nIrrespective of who started this resort to intemperate language or contributed more to what has become an unedifying part of the country’s political culture, both sides — government and opposition – are now speaking in a manner that is unseemly and unbecoming. Political leaders are supposed to set an example by their conduct and their willingness to engage in reasoned debate. But what is on display are bitter polemics, aggressive rhetoric and unceasing efforts by political leaders to demonise their opponents. Some leaders have resisted doing this but they are notable exceptions. Spokespersons of major parties have tried to outmatch the other in the use of invective and offensive words against political rivals. Government spokesmen have set a new record in the slurs directed virtually daily at the opposition and critics. For example, an official spokeswoman is only known for her undignified utterances.\nDemocracy is undermined by lack of reasoned debate on national issues.\nA consequence of this unfortunate tendency is the lack of attention given to issues that are of concern to the public at large, and that affect the country’s future. Take the example of the recentSenate electionsand earlier by-elections. On closely contested seats candidates or their party leaders and representatives had little to say on public issues or how they aim to serve the public interest. Instead, the accent was on vilifying their opponent and their rival party. An entitlement mentality was also on display; an ‘only-we-deserve-to-be-elected’ attitude without conveying what the candidates stood for. There were few efforts, if any, by competing parties to explain what their candidate will bring to public office. This was also evident in the election of the Senate chairman and deputy chairman. Before the poll, aspirants said little about how they saw their role in strengthening parliament or fulfilling the obligations of the office they sought. Their sponsoring parties didn’t either. Increasingly then elections have become little more than personalised contests.\nAll this has generated or contributed to a form of issue-less politics, where instead of the country’s challenges and policies being debated, politics and political narratives are reduced to deriding opponents. The political discourse mostly involves an exchange of incendiary rhetoric. Shallow and provocative narratives dominate the political conversation and are heard ad nauseam in television talk shows in a wearingly repetitive manner. All too frequently parliament becomes a vehicle for such attacks rather than an arena for debate on important national issues — a forum to express opinion on policy and shape opinion. This ends up devaluing parliament’s role.\nThe public impact of this is predictable. People — beyond loyal party supporters — see present-day politics as just a power struggle more and more divorced from the public’s interests and concerns. The perception that the political elite is only engaged in power games erodes respect for public representatives as well as faith in their ability to address people’s problems. Squabbling among political leaders is of course not unique to Pakistan. But if squabbles are all that define the discourse, with all else appearing secondary, that becomes cause for public cynicism.\nLack of attention paid to issues that people care about has another effect. People tend to switch off from worn-out polemics so that the discourse political leaders engage in is increasingly heard just by themselves and aims only at their political base. Audiences shrink when the same old message is repeated time and again — the dakoo and chor mantra for example. But that doesn’t seem to deter leaders or spokespersons from sounding like broken records and unable to understand that what the public really wants to know is how their aspirations will be met and national challenges tackled.\nPublic representatives have a responsibility to raise the level of discourse, and to articulate people’s concerns and how they propose to deal with them. With multiple challenges confronting the country — inflation, income erosion and jobs being at the top of the public’s priorities — it is these, among others, that should be the subject of political debate. The government should take the lead in this regard and try to engage the opposition especially in parliament in discussion of key issues and policy responses to the challenges Pakistan faces. But the PTI leadership continues to demonstrate an inability to accept the notion of opposition as legitimate, casting those who oppose the government as venal, corrupt and unpatriotic. That rules out any debate and is hardly a way to raise the political game by informed and reasoned discussion of substantive issues.\nTrust is a crucial element in building or maintaining public support. But uncivil exchanges between political leaders in the virtual absence of any rational debate on policy issues undermines trust in political leaders in general. Spokespersons may be pleasing their leadership — and securing air time — by immoderate broadsides directed against opponents but their principal emphasis on this undermines public respect for them. An IPSOS survey in December found that 77 per cent of Pakistanis felt the country was headed in the wrong direction. This is a reflection of the public’s view of the country’s leadership.\nIt is not just the political discourse that is degraded by excessively negative politicking and messaging. It has wider implications for the legitimacy of the political system in public eyes. If those working the system are seen to lack focus on national issues and are constantly attacking each other it also erodes faith in the country’s democracy. It is not just the political discourse that is debased. Democracy too is debased."}]}

This is reflected in aleaked letterfrom Secretary of State Antony Blinken to President Ashraf Ghani that sets out its proposed plan. It is also evident from the discussion draft of a peace agreement shared by the US with Afghan parties and the regional diplomacy now underway by special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.\nThese moves signal three things — a renewal of US commitment to withdraw from Afghanistan, its desire to do so after securing a peace settlement among the warring Afghan parties and the willingness to use pressure to quickly achieve this. This raises several questions. Is the Biden administration overreaching with an ambitious plan that it wants to accomplish in a limited timeframe? In deciding to mount pressure on the parties does the US have the leverage to get them to agree? Is the proposed ‘new, inclusive’ interim government an achievable goal as bitter foes will have to share power? With Washington having drafted a peace agreement, albeit for discussion, will Afghan parties take ownership of this?\nThe Biden team is vigorously engaging Kabul, the Taliban and other Afghan leaders in discussions over the peace plan and the May 1 deadline for US withdrawal with the proviso that final decisions will emerge once the review concludes. President Joe Biden has said that meeting the May 1 deadline will be tough but it won’t be extended by “a lot longer”. Meanwhile, the Taliban have warned against any delay in this deadline and of an unspecified “reaction” if this happens.\nThe US diplomatic initiative — according to the leaked letter — has four elements. One, a meeting to be convened by the UN of representatives of Russia, the US, Pakistan, Iran and India to forge regional consensus to support the peace plan. Two, a draft peace agreement to expedite negotiations on a settlement and ceasefire. A key proposal is to set up a transitional government once agreement is reached. Three, Turkey to host a meeting between the two sides to seal a peace deal. And four, a 90-day reduction in violence to avert a spring offensive by the Taliban. This plan is punctuated by the US warning that it is considering full withdrawal of forces by May 1 but not ruling out other options.\nThe US peace plan for Afghanistan faces critical tests ahead.\nBy clearly communicating that a political settlement is a priority — not just the military withdrawal, as it was for president Trump — a prudent path seems to have been outlined especially as diplomatic parleys underway will shape the conclusions of the US review.\nRegional consensus to back a peace deal is clearly necessary. This is also a way for Washington to ensure that Iran is included in the diplomatic process. No timeframe has been set for this. But the UN will have to deftly play the role expected of it. Moscow, while welcoming the transitional government idea, has not said anything on the US plan and is embarked on its own regional diplomacy including a peace conference hosted last week on Afghanistan. The Pakistan-India dynamic also has to be kept in view; Islamabad has already conveyed its misgivings over India’s inclusion in the proposed conference to US officials.\nWith two new processes now envisaged in addition to that in Doha it would be important not to allow the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha to be diluted or complicated by the proposed new ones. They should facilitate the Doha process and not replace it. The principal diplomatic effort should remain in the Doha talks.\nWashington is clearly in a hurry. Trying to force the pace of the peace process reflects US frustration with the stalled intra-Afghan talks. It also shows impatience with President Ghani’s obstructive tactics, evident from the tough tone of Blinken’s letter. The tight timeframe in which the US wants a settlement done and dusted aims to compel the two sides to negotiate seriously. Even so the expectation for negotiations to yield an expeditious outcome runs up against an ineluctable reality that the tough compromises needed for an agreement are unlikely to emerge quickly just because Washington has set a deadline. The US can intensify pressure on both sides but that doesn’t mean it has enough leverage over them to reach a speedy settlement. A senior Afghan official recently told PBS that the US has adopted a “fast food” approach, forcing everybody to consume something that is “too quick to succeed”.\nThere is also the question of whether in order to expedite the process Washington has overprescribed the elements of an agreement — drafting one itself rather than letting it emerge from negotiations. This lays it open to being viewed as an ‘imposed’ solution. While the US says it is not seeking to dictate terms and its peace agreement is a discussion draft it is yet to be determined whether Afghan parties see it the same way.\nThe idea of a transitional government, vehemently opposed by Ghani, makes sense before a more permanent government can be installed following adoption of a new constitution and elections. But can the two sides and other Afghan leaders show the accommodation needed for a workable power-sharing arrangement? In an initial response a Taliban spokesman asserted that interim governments have proven ineffective in the past but the Taliban have yet to take a firm position.\nPakistan’s interest lies in the success of intra-Afghan talks that can produce a negotiated end to the war and a lasting settlement before the full withdrawal of US forces. That is what Islamabad means by its repeated calls for a “responsible withdrawal”. It does not want its neighbour to descend into political chaos or a civil war, and sees an inclusive post-settlement government in Kabul as the best way to ensure peace and stability. It seeks assurances that Afghan territory will not be used against Pakistan. US officials have also been told that Islamabad stands ready to do what it can to help the peace process. It is however up to the Afghan parties to seize the moment as the US plan starts to unfold and faces critical tests in the months ahead."}]}

But few have explored the connection between domestic political developments and American foreign policy and the way Pakistan’s internal politics was at times influenced by geopolitical shifts in the region. Zahid Hussain’s latest book does just that. Titled No-WinWar it examines the ups and downs of Pakistan-US ties in the context of their often divergent post-9/11 views and strategies in Afghanistan. This completes the author’s trilogy — his first book Frontline Pakistan and second, The Scorpion’s Tail, offered well-researched accounts of Pakistan’s policy dilemmas in the wake of 9/11 and the country’s battle against militant groups.\nHis new book shines a light on the many paradoxes that characterised Pakistan-US ties in the shadow of the Afghan war that followed the US invasion in 2001. Zahid focuses on the contradictions of post-9/11 relations. But this relationship has always been mercurial through many phases. From the alliance forged during the Cold War to the phase after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and then the frontline role Pakistan was thrust into after 9/11, closer relations usually evolved in response to global or regional geopolitical storms. They were thus principally a function of factors extraneous to bilateral ones. Once the storms subsided the relationship was downgraded as US strategic priorities shifted.\nRead:US administration to seek ‘productive’ ties with Pakistan, says scholar\nThe roller coaster nature of the relationship has long been evident. Ties have swung in a cyclical pattern between close engagement and deep estrangement, interspersed by periods of benign disengagement. Dubbed during the Cold War as the ‘most allied ally of the US’, Pakistan became America’s most sanctioned ‘friend’ in the 1990’s after the Russian occupation of Afghanistan was rolled back as a result of Pak-US cooperation.\nEven at times of close collaboration there was often an elephant in the room. It was India during many phases. For Pakistan ties with the US were part of its external balancing strategy to address its security dilemma given its power asymmetry with a hostile India. This involved the pursuit of extraregional support to mitigate the imbalance but usually left Pakistan disappointed with Washington in the triangular Pakistan-US-India relationship.\nPakistan-US relations have been mercurial and alternated between close engagement and deep estrangement.\nPakistan’s nuclear programme was the issue that divided the two countries in the nineties even though it remained dormant in the preceding decade as the joint struggle against Russian occupation had higher priority for Washington. The divergence was to surface once the Soviets were defeated and US goals changed. Wide-ranging sanctions were imposed on Pakistan in the coercive chapter that followed. Even when re-engagement took place years later, it was defined by its mostly transactional character. Nevertheless, for Pakistan it has been a critical bilateral relationship. Islamabad sought — as it does now — to predicate relations with Washington on Pakistan’s intrinsic importance rather than as a function of a third country or be viewed through a single prism.\nWhen the two countries cooperated on a common goal it worked to their mutual benefit, as illustrated by Al Qaeda’s decimation in the region, which Zahid writes about in much detail. This did not however obscure the sharp disagreements between them over the war in Afghanistan. Conflicting views on why America’s war effort faltered generated a clash of narratives that underlined how fraught this ostensibly cooperative period became. In an insightful chapter titled ‘What’s your Plan for Afghanistan’, Zahid highlights differences over strategy by detailing the conversations between Pakistan’s army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and General David Petraeus. “You must go for reconciliation” (with the Taliban) Kayani is cited as advising the US general when Washington rolled out its new counterinsurgency strategy. But “for the Pentagon talking to the Taliban was a form of capitulation”. Kayani’s extensive parleys with various US officials saw him boldly articulate Pakistan’s position that the war needed a negotiated end. But there were then few takers of this view in Washington.\nKayani is cast in a positive light in Zahid’s book not only for being a “thinking soldier” who “had a strategic mind”. He writes approvingly of his consistent efforts to convince the US that the war was unwinnable and needed a diplomatic strategy — a view Washington came around to several years later. His role at home also gets a positive mention: “General Kayani led his forces in one of the most successful counterinsurgency campaigns in a treacherous terrain.” And “despite constant conflicts with the civilian leadership, he didn’t let the democratic process get derailed. Kayani oversaw two democratic political transitions (2008 and 2013) during his six years in office.”\nZahid’s skilful weaving of Pakistan’s internal politics, the changing fortunes of president Pervez Musharraf and US interests is one of the most compelling parts of his book. He describes how the US and UK sought to forge an alliance between pro-West moderate forces — Musharraf and the PPP — to avert a “right-wing backlash” and lend legitimacy to the military ruler. He explains why the plan went awry, with Musharraf compelled to give up the army chief’s office and then Benazir Bhutto’s tragic assassination. Thereafter Asif Zardari “became the accidental beneficiary of the reconciliation deal between Musharraf and Benazir” — in which the US ambassador Anne Patterson played a key role. He also recalls the ‘reciprocity’ Washington elicited from PPP leaders. Both Zardari and prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani assured US officials they had no problem with American drone strikes, which were immensely unpopular in the country and an infringement of Pakistan’s sovereignty.\nWriting about tensions between Zardari and the army he claims that “both the civil and the military leadership would confide sensitive information to the US envoy and use her to carry messages to the other side, underlining the growing civil-military divide”. The author’s purpose is not to indict the Pakistani leadership but to demonstrate how the dynamics of the no-win war permeated though the Pakistani power structure and shaped the politics of that period.\nFor me what is most important about the book is that it is written by a Pakistani who is not defensive about his country’s interests and who by his deep understanding of the country’s policies is able to offer Pakistan’s perspective on a pivotal period in a dispassionate and persuasive manner."}]}

Despite the deadly threat from the virus, many people’s response across the world has often been shaped by misinformation fed through digital platforms. This has either made them trivialise the disease or resort to ‘cures’ without any basis in science and only because they were circulated in social messaging as a ‘remedy’. Vaccine hesitancy in many parts of the world has also largely been driven by rumour and conspiracy theories.\nThis prompted the World Health Organisation early in the pandemic to coin the term ‘infodemic’ to refer to the flood of information and exponential spread of fabricated content. The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanom, declared: “We’re not just battling the virus, we’re also battling the trolls and conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response.” Top UN officials repeatedly warned of the grave social and health ramifications of the proliferation of misinformation and underlined the need to immunise the public against false news.\nWhile the global health crisis has seen a stream of false stories the reality is that fake news is all around us today. This presents new challenges to social stability in what has been called the post-truth era, a term that emerged a few years ago. It refers to a phenomenon, itself not new, that is generally described as one where facts are discarded and criteria for establishing the truth are contested. Instead, there is a prevalence of views that only align with people’s personal predilections or emotions.\nRead:Living in the age of 'fake news'\nWhy has fake news become so common today? Is it really so new? What explains its pervasiveness now? How damaging are the ramifications of a post-facts environment?\nRegulating technology is one thing but it is uncivil human behaviour that needs to change.\nFake news is of course not new. Fabrications and untruths have always been around. So have efforts to manipulate the truth. Fact fudging has antecedents in propaganda, long used to manipulate opinion for political aims. Propaganda comprising deceptive narratives has usually been deployed by states or political leaders and aimed at enemies abroad or opponents at home. Disinformation has been used by countries against adversaries throughout history. What distinguishes fake news from propaganda is that individuals and non-state actors are now using it with abandon in the digital age. This makes it unprecedentedly pervasive.\nIts more pronounced nature means that in its current form false news is a more recent phenomenon. It has been widely noted that it was after the Brexit vote and president Donald Trump’s 2016 election win that debate and concern emerged about the political and ethical implications of these events in which misinformation is commonly believed to have played a role in influencing voters. What then came to be called post-factual politics was described as involving deliberately disseminated falsehoods that misguided the debate and misled people.\nWhat explains the omnipresence of fake news today? It is generally agreed that this has much to do with the proliferation of information channels and expansion of social media in the digital era. Communication technology now dominates our lives like never before. Online platforms are widely regarded as the main vehicles for the spread of misinformation. Fake news easily circulates due to the magnifying power of social media and becomes viral in this mostly unregulated environment. Anonymity on social media platforms gives the purveyors of false stories and trolls the comfort that they will not be held accountable for the lies or hate messages they disseminate. Anyone can post fake news on social media without fear of retribution.\nFacebook and Twitter have been the object of mounting global criticism for this reason. Despite the raging controversy over their role, social media giants who wield immense power have yet to undertake effective self-regulation. A Unesco report notes that steps taken are at best “patchy”. As Timothy Garton Ash once wrote in The Guardian, these digital platforms have become “unprecedentedly powerful amplifiers of lies” and “the profit motive pushes them towards the dark side, via algorithmic maximization of the currency of attention”. In fact, their business model prevents them from instituting real checks on divisive content and ‘digital wildfires’.\nThe spread of fake news has also been linked to the rise of populist leaders who feel no compunction in knowingly selling fact-free narratives. Trump perfected the politics of lies. He consciously used ‘alternative facts’ and manipulated opinion by espousing conspiracy theories and fabricating threats to further his political career. But he wasn’t alone. Demagogues and their followers across the world have employed similar means for political gain, playing on people’s vulnerabilities by communicating falsehoods.\nA plausible connection has also been made between the prevalence of fake news and political polarisation. This is because in polarised society and politics people choose to believe what their partisan side transmits or what accords with their own views. They only listen to news media or follow online sites which echo their own bias. Living in information or digital ‘bubbles’ makes them susceptible to anything disseminated by their chosen information channel, true or false.\nThe harmful repercussions of the fake news phenomenon are manifold. An environment where truth is blurred can have far-reaching consequences — misleading people, damaging social cohesion by eroding a sense of shared interest, debasing politics, undermining civic obligations, and even sowing public disorder.\nAlso, as president Barack Obama once famously remarked “fake news is a threat to democracy”. When political debate is degraded by falsehoods and bereft of reason, democracy is jeapardised. By playing off and reinforcing polarisation, narratives based on untruths that demonise ‘the other’ corrode a sense of community and are deeply divisive. Trust also declines in public institutions as misleading information often sows doubts and cynicism. The pernicious effects of hate speech, harassment, online extremism and lies spread against minorities need no elaboration.\nHow these dangers can be mitigated is an imposing challenge of our times. Solutions offered range from greater online regulation, increased monitoring and oversight by social media companies to removing toxic content and ending user anonymity. How effective they can be remains to be seen. Regulating technology is one thing but it is uncivil human behaviour that really needs to change."}]}

At times these have landed its leadership in embarrassing situations while on other occasions it has obliged the government to make U-turns on pronouncements it has been hard-pressed to explain.\nRecent developments have laid bare the first such proclivity — announcing a decision without sufficient thought or consultation and then reversing it. The case in point was the newly appointed finance minister’s pronouncement that Pakistan will be resuming trade with India by importing cotton and sugar. The decision was apparently approved by Prime Minister Imran Khan as he holds the commerce portfolio. This was also indicated by a leaked summary to the cabinet signed by him. In less than 24 hours the decision wasrevoked by the cabinet.It was followed by reiteration of Pakistan’s position that trade with India was not possible until Delhi reversed its Aug 5, 2019 action in occupied Kashmir. Apparently, the backlash after the initial announcement as well as opposition in the cabinet compelled the government to backtrack.\nWhat this episode revealed was a governance style in which important decisions are taken without forethought, consultation or assessment of implications and whether they are consistent with previously stated positions. In this case there were far-reaching foreign policy implications which were overlooked as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was obviously not consulted at any stage. It was not the first time a decision with foreign policy consequences was taken without adequate thought and institutional advice. An earlier, well-known example was when the government announced the PM would attend a summit called by Malaysia along with Turkey which it laterwent back onin response to strong Saudi objections. As widely noted at the time this episode entailed foreign policy costs. In statements made on a range of other issues U-turns have been even more common.\nA second habit that has evolved into a trait is to frequently change senior ministers and officials in a revolving door approach to team members. The decision toremove Hafeez Sheikhand replace him with Hammad Azhar meant appointing a third finance minister in as many years. Apart from the unseemly manner in which this was done — a hallmark of this government — only two weeks earlier Sheikh had been asked by the PM to stay on when he offered to resign following his defeat in the Senate election. The PM had consistently been praising his own government’s economic policies as well as Sheikh’s performance — until public criticism mounted over rising prices. This suggested that Sheikh may have been made a scapegoat to defuse such criticism.\nThe PTI leadership needs to shake off habits that often land it in self-created difficulties.\nThis was only the latest example of the government’s penchant for frequently changing key ministers and top officials. The present interior minister is the third to have been appointed. The new chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue is the fifth to be installed while the Board of Investment has had four different chairmen during this government’s tenure. This approach has been mirrored in even more pronounced terms in Punjab. The chief minister has constantly shuffled officials; the present chief secretary is the fourth, the IGP the sixth and commissioner, Lahore division, is also the sixth in his administration. At the centre, the interior secretary has been changed five times and the commerce secretary is the fourth to serve under this government.\nFrequent bureaucratic changes signify a whimsical way of governing and often reflect knee-jerk reactions to the criticism of the day. Changing the finance minister and top economic functionaries every so often may also be a reflection of a vain search for quick solutions to vexed issues that require policy continuity and patience to address. PTI insiders say the PM’s view of a top team member has much to do with who has his ear and what he may be whispering about him/her.\nA third aspect of the government is its increasing lack of confidence in institutions despite its leaders’ frequent claims of strengthening institutions. This is illustrated by the way its ministerslashed out against the Election Commission of Pakistanafter the February Daska by-election and losing the Islamabad seat in the Senate. The PM himself made ECP the target of criticism. The government may be following a well-established tradition of political leaders attacking institutions when they don’t play ball, but that doesn’t minimise the significance of its conduct on this score. For its part, the ECP reminded the government that it was a constitutional and independent body that acted according to the law and “if constitutional institutions continue to be ridiculed in this way it is tantamount to their (government’s) weakness and not ECP’s”.\nAnother example of the same phenomenon is therecent removalof the head of the Higher Education Commission. The chairperson’s tenured post was for four years whereas the incumbent had served only two. The government reduced its duration to two years by ordinance in order to force the chairman out overnight. Again, it showed disregard for an institution, that too in the education sector. There was widespread criticism of this assault on HEC’s autonomy. It also prompted a strong rebuke from respected philanthropist, entrepreneur and moving spirit behind HEC’s creation, Syed Babar Ali, who in a letter to the concerned minister, wrote that education should not be destroyed in this manner and HEC should be “protected from such machinations”.\nThe government’s fourth characteristic is to treat publicity and projection as a substitute for policy. The constant meetings the PM holds with his media spokespersons is one indication. Another is the daily pressers by spokespersons who have little of substance to convey other than hyperbolic claims about government performance. This underlines the leadership’s reliance on rhetoric to show it is governing effectively rather than let policy measures speak for themselves. When exaggerated narratives clash with lack of policy delivery it is the government’s credibility that is undermined.\nThese traits disadvantage the PTI government in dealing with the country’s multiple challenges. Its ability to seriously address them depends on how far it can shake off habits that frequently mire it in self-created difficulties."}]}

They reflect a shared history, military, trade, cultural and educational ties as well as Britain’s role as a development partner and increasingly, the importance of the Pakistani/Kashmiri diaspora in serving as a living bridge between the two countries. This doesn’t mean there haven’t been disagreements on key regional and other issues. But that has rarely diminished the warmth in relations.\nOver the decades a significant section of Pakistan’s political and business elite went to college in the UK, which contributed to closer bonds. Tens of thousands of Pakistanis travel to Britain every year for business, tourism or to visit family; on average 60,000 visit visas have been issued annually in recent years. This strengthens the people-to-people dimension. Diplomatic interaction on multilateral issues is considerable given Britain is a permanent member of the UN Security Council — a factor Pakistan considers important in dealings with London. Historically the British media was seen by Islamabad as a key source of influence in the English-speaking world which could shape perceptions about the country. While its global impact is arguably less today it remains an important vehicle for Pakistan to get its narrative out.\nPakistan-UK relations have been remarkably stable and increasingly energised by the Pakistani diaspora.\nFor all these reasons a new book by the British academic Ian Talbot should interest readers in the country. The History of BritishDiplomacy in Pakistan chronicles Britain’s diplomacy from Pakistan’s inception, formative phase and subsequent decades through its political crises, military interventions, the country’s break-up, wars and near wars until the ‘War on Terror’. The well-researched book turns out to be a tour d’horizon of Pakistan’s tumultuous history and various turning points. But it tells the story from a British perspective and the vantage point of its foreign policy goals.\nHaving served as high commissioner to the UK I am in agreement with several of Talbot’s observations. His assertion that British envoys had easy access to Pakistan’s policymakers was mirrored by my own experience of being able to reach top British government ministers, officials and MPs without a problem. London also provides extraordinary opportunities for public diplomacy and soft power initiatives, which our Mission vigorously undertook. For example, we organised a mega-concert showcasing our culture at Trafalgar Square to mark the 60th anniversary of Pakistan’s independence. British Pakistanis participated enthusiastically.\nThe success of the Pakistani diaspora has been impressive. British Pakistanis have engaged vigorously in politics with several elected to Parliament and many serving as mayors including the high-profile mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Today, there are 27 MPs of Pakistani origin, 15 elected to the House of Commons, 12 in the House of Lords and well over 300 local councillors. British Pakistanis are also prominent in the media and have made a mark in many other fields. The frontline role of diaspora doctors in the National Health Service response to the ongoing pandemic has earned them much appreciation. Talbot rightly notes the key role of British Pakistanis and, in describing “diaspora diplomacy”, highlights London’s use of the diaspora to reinforce ties with Islamabad.\nFrom among the principal takeaways from the book, two are noteworthy. One, Talbot’s description of UK’s ties with Pakistan being based on “sentiment” in contrast to America’s relationship with Islamabad that has been “transactional”. The latter however reflects the reality of an asymmetrical relationship as superpowers tend to be more transactional. UK’s ties with Pakistan also have transactional aspects but they do not define the relationship. Talbot argues that “while Washington utilised ‘hard power’ to forward its interests, Britain had ‘soft power’ in terms of cultural and historical ties”.\nHe accords importance to “personal diplomacy” and colonial and post-colonial era links forged by British diplomats with Pakistan’s political and military elite. This brings up the second takeaway; that in relations with Pakistan, Britain exercised an influence far greater than its political, economic and military power. After 1954, “personal diplomacy compensated for Britain’s diminishing power” writes Talbot. Britain punched above its weight in no small measure owing to the activism of its many distinguished envoys including Nicholas Barrington and Mark Lyall Grant — a tradition the present incumbent Christian Turner is living up to.\nIn the foreword, Bob Milam, former US ambassador to Pakistan, makes the point that given the colonial past and longer association, the British understood Pakistan far better than the Americans and like his predecessors, he often turned to British diplomats for advice. The book details how the UK and US worked in lockstep on common goals through the years. Of course, the two countries have different equities in relations with Pakistan but this distinction is often blurred in official and popular perceptions in Pakistan. That sometimes made it difficult for me as envoy to explain to Islamabad that on a specific issue London was not acting at Washington’s behest.\nTwo portions of the book that are especially interesting deal with early Western efforts at mediation on Kashmir and involvement of British and American diplomats in Pakistan’s 2008 democratic transition. Talbot says that it was the 1962 Sino-Indian conflict that sparked Western concern about the Chinese ‘threat’ and “created the circumstances for a protracted Western attempt at mediation over Kashmir”. He recounts that Washington wanted Britain to play a leading mediatory role in the Anglo-American effort to encourage the two countries towards a settlement. Several rounds of the Bhutto-Swaran Singh talks however ended in failure as the positions of Pakistan and India proved unbridgeable.\nAs for the 2008 events, Talbot narrates the role played by Britain and America in forging the deal between president Musharraf and Benazir Bhutto. The highly secretive diplomacy he recalls began in 2004 and led to Mark Lyall Grant’s trips to Dubai and US assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher’s “active engagement” with Benazir and Musharraf. At US urging, Grant arranged the first phone call between them in 2006. Talbot claims that Condoleezza Rice played a “crucial role” in the eventual deal which she herself earlier acknowledged in her own book.\nTalbot’s book is an eminently readable account of a relationship that has been remarkably stable and which is now being energised by its growing people-to-people content."}]}

It leaves the nascent peace process in disarray at least for now. The conference co-hosted by the UN, Turkey and Qatar was scheduled for April 24-May 4 in Istanbul. Announcing its postponement until after the end of Ramazan, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said that in view of the Taliban’s non-participation it was “meaningless” to press ahead especially as there was “no clarity about the formation of delegations and participation”.\nThe conference was being calibrated by Washington with its plans to completely withdraw from Afghanistan. Announcing this in his much-anticipated address on April 14 President Joe Biden boldly acknowledged that nothing more could be achieved by retaining US troops in the country and all would be pulled out by Sept 11. He said once Al Qaeda had been degraded and Osama bin Laden eliminated a decade earlier, the US goal was achieved but its presence in Afghanistan continued for another decade for increasingly unclear reasons. Rejecting the Pentagon’s preference for a conditions-based drawdown, Biden said: “We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create the ideal conditions for our withdrawal, expecting a different result.”\nRead:Ending the ‘forever war’\nUnder the Doha agreement between the US and Taliban, forged in February 2020, American forces were to fully withdraw by May 1 in exchange for the Taliban commitment to prevent Afghanistan’s soil from being used by terrorists and agreeing to intra-Afghan talks. Even before Biden’s announcement the Taliban had declared they would not participate in the Istanbul talks and threatened “consequences” if the withdrawal deadline was shifted. Washington probably hoped that by giving a final and unconditional deadline for its departure the Taliban would accept the decision. But the Taliban maintained a tough posture and responded to Biden’s speech by reiterating their position that delay in the pullout was a breach of the Doha agreement for which “necessary counter-measures” would be taken. They refused to attend the Turkey conference and said that creating expectations this would yield a peace deal was an effort “to push the Taliban willingly or unwillingly, to a rushed decision which was needed by America”.\nPlans for the ‘Istanbul Conference on the Afghan Peace Process’ had been set in train by the US weeks before its withdrawal announcement. A leaked letter from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to President Ashraf Ghani laid out key elements of the American proposal. They included a UN-led peace conference in Turkey attended by regional and other ‘partners’ to mobilise a consensus to support the peace plan followed by a meeting between the Afghan parties to finalise a peace deal. A joint statement by the UN, Turkey and Qatar cast the aim of the conference in ambitious terms: “The Conference will focus on helping the negotiating parties reach a set of shared, foundational principles that reflect an agreed vision for a future Afghanistan, a roadmap to a future political settlement and an end to the conflict.”\nAll stakeholders know if the path of negotiation is abandoned the country will descend into chaos.\nDriving this effort with a sense of urgency was, of course, the US in the hope of accelerating the peace talks into making significant progress ahead of its withdrawal deadline. Intense shuttle diplomacy by its special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in the region was aimed at persuading the Afghan parties to attend the Istanbul Conference and give an impetus to the peace process.\nThe postponement raises many questions. Is the Turkey peace conference stillborn? Can the peace process be revived? If so, can progress be made to reach a settlement before the US withdrawal? Will the US leave without a peace deal? Will the Taliban wait for the departure of American/Nato forces to strengthen their hand in peace negotiations afterwards?\nThe answer to all of the above turns principally on the Taliban’s calculation as well as to how much leverage — and interest — the US has to push the peace effort. Indications are that the Americans will remain engaged in diplomatic efforts and seem serious in wanting a peace deal or at least progress towards it before their departure. This would be an important element of face-saving for Washington and also enable an orderly and ‘honourable’ exit. That is why behind the scenes talks are also focused on negotiating a 90-day reduction of violence with the Taliban. As for leverage, while the effectiveness of coercive pressure has been diminishing with the withdrawal underway, the UN sanctions process remains a source of leverage as de-listing is among the Taliban’s main demands. In any case, the Doha accord committed Washington to begin this process once intra-Afghan talks commenced. The US along with the international community can also use economic incentives by holding out the promise of assistance after September. This is also the hope expressed by top US diplomats as well as Pakistani officials.\nThe Taliban while adopting a tough posture have nonetheless kept space open for engagement and significantly refrained from announcing their spring offensive. The thinking among field commanders may be that all the Taliban need to do is wait it out for the US to depart and there is little value in engaging in peace talks where they will have to make concessions. However, the leadership’s calculation may be different. They may feel they have more to gain from resuming the peace dialogue than abandoning it especially as they would not want to risk losing the international recognition and legitimacy they now have. Release of their prisoners and removal from UN sanctions can only be secured through diplomatic engagement. They may also see an opportunity after two decades of military struggle to secure their goal through negotiations — an option that would help them elicit international support and assistance needed in post-America Afghanistan and importantly, offer a better chance of achieving lasting peace.\nFor these reasons the Afghan peace process is far from being dead even if it faces daunting challenges ahead. All stakeholders, and above all, the Afghan parties know that if the path of negotiation is abandoned Afghanistan will descend into chaos and strife from which no one will benefit."}]}

Efforts to de-escalate tensions between the two nuclear neighbours are always welcome. But given the history of false starts and the one step forward, two steps backwards engagement in this long-troubled relationship it is important to take into account lessons of the past and on-ground realities, especially as the dire situation created by India in occupied Kashmir remains unchanged.\nRead:The road to peace with India will take much more than the desire for better relations\nThere is nothing unusual about a backchannel. It is frequently used when formal dialogue between countries is suspended. This was often the case in the past when Pakistan and India demurred from engaging in open talks. Backchannels are useful to confidentially probe, explore and assess how much give there is in the other’s position. This is harder in a formal forum where negotiating parties stick to maximalist positions at least at the start. During the Musharraf period backchannel negotiations on the Kashmir dispute took place over three years to find an interim settlement. This marked the most serious effort in recent decades to find a political solution of Kashmir. The talks were conducted by civil servants who enjoyed the confidence of president Pervez Musharraf and prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\nWhat has been disclosed about the current backchannel is that talks are being conducted by the chiefs of intelligence of the two countries. This isn’t the only difference from past backroom efforts. The Musharraf era process began with a public acknowledgment by both sides of the resumption of formal talks. The joint statement of Jan 6, 2004 stated that “the resumption of the composite dialogue will lead to peaceful settlement of all bilateral issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, to the satisfaction of both sides”. The backchannel subsequently set in train was an accompaniment to formal talks that covered all issues of priority for both sides. Negotiators on the backchannel were publicly named.\nWhile information about the present backchannel has been revealed by Pakistani officials this has been met by silence on the Indian side. There have been no background briefings or leaks by Indian officials. This one-sided admission may have unwittingly created the impression of over-eagerness by the Pakistani side. Moreover, making public disclosures at a preliminary stage of sensitive talks raises the question of whether it is prudent before anything significant has been agreed.\nPeace with honour should remain the immutable principle of Pakistan’s engagement with India.\nAs the present engagement is being cast as ‘talks about talks’ it might be useful to keep the following factors and principles in view.\nOne, Pakistani interlocutors should seek to test and verify — assess if the Indian move is tactical or strategic and proceed cautiously. Our officials claim India is prepared to talk on all issues. What should be ascertained is what exactly is meant by that. Whether it means Indian willingness for substantive discussion on outstanding disputes including Kashmir or just a ‘dialogue of the deaf’ and re-statement of its familiar position that Kashmir is India’s ‘internal matter’ and the ‘new’ status quo created by its Aug 5, 2019, action is non-negotiable.\nTwo, Pakistan must maintain its red lines on its principled position on Kashmir especially as Indian media reports suggest that Delhi’s expectation is for Pakistan to cease insisting on reversal of the illegal annexation of Kashmir. While pursuing the near-term aim, as identified by Pakistani officials, of providing ‘relief to the Kashmiri people’, presumably through CBMs, this should be done in tandem with and not as substitute for substantive talks on the issue. Again, past experience is instructive. Kashmir-specific CBMs agreed in the composite dialogue during 2004-08 were an accompaniment to and not replacement of negotiations on Kashmir.\nThree, ‘process’ in the backchannel should not be mistaken for substance. It has long been India’s aim to draw Pakistan into a process with no outcomes in settling disputes and thus to demonstrate to the world how reasonable it is without conceding anything. Delhi has sought to achieve normalisation on its terms without resolving disputes and instead prioritising the two T’s, terrorism and trade. From this perspective, normalisation for the sake of normalisation should be avoided as this will be transient, lack substantive content and therefore durability. De-escalation of tensions is an aim worth pursuing but that is different from normalisation, which should be predicated on efforts and progress in resolving differences. Normalisation can only come about gradually and should be distinguished from managing tensions.\nFour, the backchannel should not become the sole track of Pakistan-India engagement. It should lead to the resumption of formal and comprehensive dialogue. India’s apparent suggestion in the backchannel that issues should not be ‘bundled up’ in a composite dialogue is fraught with risk. It seems a way for Delhi to focus mainly on its priority areas and avoid a broad-based, integrated dialogue that Islamabad has long wanted.\nRevival of track one peace talks is also necessary because engagement confined only to a backchannel will give the other side much wriggle room precisely because informal talks may not bind parties to any commitment. In any case agreements reached in track two have to be formalised in ‘front channel’ talks. Diplomatic negotiations should be conducted by experienced diplomats who are best equipped to deal with them. The foreign ministry should also be consulted and kept fully on board on backchannel talks.\nFive, announcements should only be made once there is progress in the backchannel and through mutual agreement by both sides. Significantly, conciliatory statements by Prime Minister Imran Khan and army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa have not been reciprocated by Indian leaders. This as well as Delhi’s lack of comment on the backchannel may be designed to convey that Pakistan is keener on normalising ties owing to its domestic vulnerabilities and compulsions. This plays off an unwitting impression created by some Pakistani officials who have said the country’s weak economy is the principal motivation for its peace overture to India.\nLast but not least, peace with honour should remain the immutable principle of Pakistan’s engagement with India."}]}

Weakening of the instruments of governance has meant that even the most well conceived and crafted government policy cannot be robustly implemented.\nA case in point is the challenge of raising government revenue on which hinges the country’s ability to address its chronic budget deficits and establish sustainable macroeconomic stability. Almost every government has declared this as its priority goal. But it has always remained elusive. Lack of political will has of course been a factor but also important is weakness of the apparatus charged with performing this task. Achieving economic recovery and setting Pakistan on a path of growth and investment depends critically on strengthening institutional capacity that can competently raise resources, ensure efficient service delivery and create an environment in which a level playing field is assured to build business confidence.\nTransformational change in the apparatus of governance is an imperative, not a choice.\nThe declining capacity of the state machinery is the cumulative result of several factors. Among these two stand out. One, postponed reforms and two, politicisation of the civil service. Governance after independence required transforming the colonial-era administrative structures to those responsive to the needs of a developing country. For decades this was ignored which left the state machinery poorly equipped to deal with new challenges and out of sync with public expectations. Moreover, the elite that ruled the country had little incentive to reform as its power and privileges derived from maintaining the status quo. Lack of reform meant that the administrative system was unable to keep pace with a changing society and the complex requirements of modern governance.\nRead:What does the state really want?\nWorse, in the seventies, eighties and nineties, protracted politicisation of the bureaucratic and police system distorted its functioning and involved a number of damaging consequences — erosion of authority, undermining of efficiency and draining of morale. For these reasons the civil service ceased attracting the best and the brightest as it once did. Merit and professionalism were cast aside as both military and civilian governments used state machinery for political ends. Ruling elites failed to see that this kind of sustained manipulation would ultimately leave governments with less rather than more control. Over time the consequences of these actions caught up and left the country with a weakened, unreformed state apparatus unable to efficiently perform its core functions.\nThis created a compelling need for institutional reform involving a comprehensive approach rather than piecemeal efforts. A systemic problem needed a systemic response. Several commissions for government reform were set up and measures announced at various times but they were isolated steps in select areas and not what was required to make the civil service fit for purpose and people-friendly. Recommendations by the National Commission on Government Reforms, appointed in 2006 during the Musharraf era, remained unimplemented under subsequent governments.\nFast forward to 2018 when PTI came to power pledging to make reform a priority. Its election manifesto acknowledged that past civil service reform efforts were not “able to depoliticise the service, or attract bright young talent on merit, and technical expertise”. The government appointed Dr Ishrat Husain as adviser for institutional reform and set up two task forces on civil service reform and restructuring of government.\nThis was encouraging and showed serious intent. Dr Husain did an impressive job in casting a wide net for consultations with stakeholders. But subsequently announced measures did not translate into systemic reform. While acknowledging that an integrated approach was needed as different components of reform were interrelated, a patchwork of steps was taken. These addressed some training and performance aspects while other issues, including recruitment and induction, as well as compensation and benefits, are said to be a work in progress. The expectation that provinces would pursue their own reform effort was never realised; no province has undertaken such an endeavor.\nThe limits of such reform measures were also illustrated by the lack of impact on a key ministry — the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose requirements have changed significantly over the years as foreign policy has become more complex and needs specialised knowledge and new communication skills. It is unclear how many of even the modest proposals accepted by other federal government branches have translated into changes at the Foreign Office. There is little evidence of any change in the training, skill development, working methods and outlook of the foreign service, which needs its own set of reforms to make it fit for purpose.\nIn March more changes were announced by the government but these did not go beyond dealing with efficiency and discipline rules. What were billed as ‘new’ measures simply converted existing promotion policy into promotion rules. This did not add up to the transformational civil service reform pledged by the PTI government.\nInstead of this piecemeal tinkering a comprehensive approach is needed which transforms state institutions to respond to the requirements of modern governance. The interlinked elements of reform should involve the following: fundamental changes in recruitment and training that are predicated on an understanding of the complex nature of contemporary governance, professionalising the service by acquisition of specialised skills and technological know-how, incentivising performance by clear criteria, spelling out measurable deliverables, streamlining decision-making processes to ensure quicker decisions, promoting only the most competent to higher grades and weeding out deadwood and poor performers by severance packages.\nAbove all, the aim of reform should be to depoliticise the civil service by ensuring merit in postings and transfers, a key element that remains conspicuous by its absence so far. Frequent shuffling of top personnel by ministers and chief ministers exemplifies this. Civil servants should be free of political influence to perform their job rather than be expected to do the bidding of political patrons.\nSurveys show that public confidence in government institutions has been in long-term decline. If this is to be reversed governance has to substantially improve and make an appreciable difference in the lives of citizens. Transformational change in the apparatus of governance is an imperative, not a choice."}]}

President Joe Biden describes ties between the two as “extreme competition”, not conflict. The latest US intelligence report casts China as America’s top national security threat. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says there are three aspects of the relationship with China — adversarial, competitive and cooperative. Top Chinese officials caution Washington against engaging in a new cold war, and stress that both countries have more to gain by cooperation. American officials shrug off the cold war analogy and claim they are not seeking to contain China. Many Western analysts see a fierce contest rather than a cold war between the economic and tech superpowers.\nHow should these varying characterisations be viewed? What do they hold for the future of the world’s most consequential relationship? How are other countries responding to this stand-off? Will these global powers be able to achieve a reset or will their confrontation become a lasting feature of the international landscape?\nThe world’s most critical relationship, between US and China, is likely to remain on an unstable course.\nThe general expectation that Sino-US relations would be less fraught in the post-Trump era has not materialised. In substance, maybe less in tone, the Biden administration’s approach marks a continuity with Trump’s policy. Early indication of this came from the first diplomatic engagement between them in March. This is worth recalling for its insight into the stance of the two countries. Harsh exchanges followed in the Anchorage meeting when Blinken rai­sed his country’s “deep concerns” over China’s act­ions in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang”, its cyber-attacks and “economic coercion” toward US allies.\nRead:Kissinger recognises Pakistan’s role in establishing China-US ties\nTo Blinken’s remarks, China’s top diplomat res­po­nded bluntly saying the US could no longer speak to China from a position of strength and that it could hardly lecture others given its treatment of Native Americans and when it faces race problems at home and waning public confidence in its democracy. As for Blinken’s claim that he was speaking for the int­e­rnational community Yang Jiechi said the US didn’t represent world opinion and neither did the West.\nDespite these tough messages Chinese diplomats insisted that the new global situation warranted a cooperative relationship between the two countries. They cited President Xi Jinping’s vision of relations: “No conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win.” This did not elicit a positive response from the US side.\nOff to a bumpy start, relations did not transition into a ‘reset’ mode in subsequent months. Far from normalising they continued to be tense. While Chi­na’s interest lies in defusing tensions and establishing peaceful relations to enable them to manage differences, the US has continued to stoke tensions by its aggressive stance. In fact, the only difference bet­ween the Trump approach and Biden’s is that the latter is trying to round up allies and countries to join it to counter China. For example, the US used the recent G7 meeting to mobilise a joint front aga­inst China. The G7 communiqué criticised China on human rights, policy in Hong Kong and supported Taiwan’s participation in WHO. Another example is the so-called Quad (Australia, India, Japan and US) Washington is lining up to confront China.\nWhy is the Biden administration adopting this stance? For several reasons. First, it is reflecting the anti-China mood and bipartisan consensus in America that sees China as an adversary whose rising power needs to be balanced. Trump’s demonisation of China as a manipulative economic power that engaged in unfair trade practices became a national narrative and set the context for the Biden administration’s approach. Moreover, the Republican Party’s constant attacks on Biden for being ‘soft’ on China also shaped a more hawkish position than his administration may otherwise have adopted.\nBut because American companies see China as an attractive economic opportunity, continue doing lucrative business there and banks are keen to expand, US officials are obliged to acknowledge the ‘cooperative’ aspect of relations. But in fusing this with an adversarial dimension Washington seems to adopt an incoherent or schizophrenic approach that is contributing to turbulent relations with China.\nUS actions to counter China are also a classic response of an established superpower to the rise of a new global power challenging its predominance. This has been a common phenomenon throughout history when power dynamics have shifted fundamentally. The fear of an economic and technological rival and its growing global reach has created insecurities being reflected today in US behaviour.\nYet there are limits to how far Washington can escalate tensions. As Andrew Bacevich, president of the Quincy Institute, has written, “Today, China produces almost everything that American consumers hanker to buy, which we do using money agreeably loaned by Chinese banks. In Washington, denouncing Beijing’s authoritarianism may make for a good applause line. Yet the reality is that our two nations are mutually dependent.”\nLimits are also imposed by the unenthusiastic response from countries Washington is wooing for its anti-China alliance. Even close European allies, with economic equities in ties with China, are reluctant to be drawn into such a coalition. Biden told the Munich conference in April that US and its allies faced “long-term strategic competition” with China and needed to stand up to its “economic abuses and coercion”. But Europe, much less the rest of the world, doesn’t see it the same way. German Chancellor Angela Merkel says so openly, Japan is reluctant to sanction China and other Asian countries are even less willing to join any contain-China coalition. Whether this reality urges the US towards a conciliatory policy is to be seen.\nBeijing has shown much forbearance in the face of aggressive US conduct but a more confident China has also pushed back against what it perceives as US bullying and intimidation. Growing nationalist sentiment in the country means that Beijing will continue to act assertively even as it seeks a calmer, cooperative relationship with the US. As President Xi declared recently in the Boao forum, any economic decoupling between the two global powers would be to the world’s detriment.\nWhile predictions of a conflict between the two countries are clearly overdrawn the world’s most critical bilateral relationship is likely to remain on an unstable course for at least the near term."}]}

Refugee camps bombarded by Israeli forces, children killed in missile attacks, buildings targeted and destroyed, people watching helplessly as bodies of family members were pulled out of the rubble and thousands left homeless and traumatised. The humanitarian crisis unleashed by Israeli aggression affected every Palestinian.\nRead:The mental scars of the children of Gaza\nThe Israeli military onslaught against the Palestinians added another grim chapter to over 70 years of brutality and suffering inflicted on a dispossessed and displaced people by an occupying power. Palestinians have been forced out of their homeland, deprived of their land and subjected to unceasing repression, arbitrary arrests and collective punishment. They have seen entire neighbourhoods being demolished and people uprooted to make way for illegal Israeli settlements. Gaza’s two million inhabitants have suffered 14 years of a blockade and cruel restrictions imposed by Israel.\nAgainst this backdrop of historical injustice, it took only a spark for the situation to erupt in which the occupying power rained havoc but was met by resistance from people armed only with an unshakable belief in their cause. The trigger for the latest flare-up was a combination of factors — an unprovoked police assault on worshippers at Al Aqsa Mosque during Ramazan and eviction of Palestinians from their homes in occupied East Jerusalem’s neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah.\nA ceasefire has brought the latest Israeli aggression to an end but this will only be a lull before the next storm.\nWhat followed were mass protests by Palestinians in Gaza, in cities and villages across the West Bank and in Israel. They were ruthlessly crushed by Israeli forces. Rocket attacks by Hamas followed and then indiscriminate Israeli airstrikes that claimed the lives of more than 240 Palestinians including over 65 children.\nWhile this carnage continued for 11 days, the OIC issued a statement of condemnation but contemplated no collective action. The statement was long on rhetoric but short on action. Arab countries that recently established diplomatic relations weren’t asked to suspend those ties. In fact, their so-called normalisation policy towards Israel may have emboldened Tel Aviv to act with impunity.\nThe US and its Western allies were blindsided to the Palestinian plight by their unflinching support for Israel. US leaders called for “de-escalation” after days of crisis. An emergency UN Security Council meeting was delayed for days, because of Washington. When it met, the US repeatedly blocked a statement that all other 14 members of the Council agreed on, which called for de-escalation, an end to evictions of Palestinian families and respect for international humanitarian law. This left the US isolated at the UN but did not persuade Washington to modify its stance.\nNone of this was surprising. The US, as Israel’s principal benefactor, has long protected its closest ally and shown little of the concern for Palestinian rights that it routinely voices about human rights violations elsewhere. Many Western governments echoed the US in voicing support for Israel’s right to self-defence against attacks by Hamas. Nevertheless, countries like Norway and Ireland, both non-permanent members of UNSC, voiced concern for civilian casualties including children from Israeli airstrikes and asked that Israel cease its settlement activities. Russia warned Israel that more civilian casualties in Gaza were intolerable and called for an end to violence.\nWhile the latest eruption in Palestine’s long and tragic history has familiar echoes, some dimensions of the crisis were a departure from the past and could prove consequential. The first difference was the scale of protests by Palestinians that simultaneously took place across the occupied territories and in Israel. Never before had Palestinians living in Israel joined the protests in the numbers witnessed. Even otherwise biased reports in the New York Times acknowledged that the protests were “finding new footholds and threatening the veneer of Israeli society in ways not seen before”. The Guardian noted that the outpouring of support from Israel’s Palestinian citizens created a “new front” inside Israel rarely witnessed in the past. The unprecedented anger ‘within’ was widely attributed to what Human Rights Watch in a recent report called Israel’s apartheid policies towards Arabs who constitute a fifth of its population.\nAnother unprecedented aspect of the crisis was the show of popular solidarity with Palestinians across the world, that too in times of a pandemic. In Muslim nations this was to be expected but the scale of protests was significant, while Western countries, including the US and UK, also saw big demonstrations. This wave of global public support contrasted sharply with the positions adopted by governments especially in the West, although bold voices in the US Congress and other Western parliaments were a call of conscience for them. President Biden faced growing criticism from progressive Democrats for his stance. It also prompted prominent American opinion makers to assert that the “unshakable bonds of friendship” with Israel were shaking in America “especially in the Democratic party”. A Gallup poll for example found that over half of Democrats felt the US should lean on Israel to make concessions rather than the Palestinians.\nWhile a ceasefire has brought the latest Israeli aggression to an end this will only be a lull before the next storm. The ineluctable reality is that the unresolved Palestinian issue remains a collective failure of the international community. Scores of UNSC and General Assembly resolutions have called for an end to the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine. There are 88 Security Council resolutions on the Palestine question. The answer to the dispute, the oldest on the UN agenda, has long been spelt out in several resolutions — a two-state solution that ensures a viable and independent State of Palestine. But in recent years Israel was encouraged by president Donald Trump’s policies into abandoning the two-state ‘solution’ and sought instead to impose a one-state ‘solution’ while expanding illegal settlements in violation of UNSC Resolution 2334 and in defiance of international demands to cease this activity.\nInaction on these resolutions is an indictment of those members of the global community who possess the power to effect change but are unwilling to act because of a blind commitment to Israel and contrary to their claims to respect international law and abide by a rules-based international order."}]}

But then strategies are crafted and preparations made way ahead of time. Political parties will in any case be in election mode in a year’s time. The stakes are high for all sides in a politically fraught environment in which confrontation politics continues to be the dominant dynamic.\nEven as efforts are underway to revive the moribund opposition alliance — PDM — there is an unstated acceptance among opposition parties that that there is little point expending political capital in trying to unseat the government, which is unlikely to succeed anyway. Far better to conserve and focus energies on the election. This doesn’t mean the opposition will relent on efforts to mount pressure on the government and subject it to fierce criticism. That campaign will intensify all the way to the polls, as will the government’s attempts to vilify and discredit its opponents. The upcoming budget session is expected to be stormy and likely to see bitter clashes in parliament.\nRead:PTI, PML-N and PPP are gradually accepting they will have to deal with the establishment\nBoth the ruling party and its political competitors face imposing challenges ahead. For the PTI government the challenge is perhaps greater. Because even at the peak of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s popularity his party failed to secure a majority in the last election and had to forge a coalition with a motley group of parties and independents to form the government. For this it also needed decisive help from the establishment. In Punjab its government rested — and still rests — on a wafer-thin majority.\nIn any case, an incumbent party always faces an uphill task not least because public expectations almost always outpace government delivery. On performance, the PTI government hasn’t exactly lived up to popular hopes including those of its own political base. True that the pandemic magnified challenges and threw the government off course, like its counterparts across the world. But voters are unforgiving and at election time their choices are mainly shaped by the ruling party’s economic record and how it has affected their economic well-being. Notwithstanding its claims to have steered the economy towards stability the exponentially rising cost of living has been a key factor for growing public disenchantment with the PTI government. This and the overall lack of governance have contributed to the political setbacks faced by the party in successive national and provincial by-elections. Usually, the incumbent party has an advantage in by-elections. But PTI has lost virtually every by-election, and on some seats fared particularly poorly. In the recent Karachi by-election, it came fifth on a seat it had previously won.\nAll parties face daunting challenges as they gear up for elections ahead.\nThe ruling party is also in a state of organisational dysfunction and facing significant discontent among its parliamentary members both at the centre and Punjab. This was dramatically exposed by the sequence of events that led to an informal group forming around Jahangir Tareen. Quite apart from these legislators’ support for a capable political leader who played a pivotal role in the party’s electoral success and is seen to be a victim of trumped-up charges, they also have their own set of grievances. But this is only the latest expression of disaffection in a party also afflicted by in-fighting.\nSome of the disgruntlement among party backbenchers is the result of the lack of attention from the PM, who rarely shows up in parliament. But it is also related to the weak Punjab leadership and its inability to address their concerns. This in turn points to a bigger problem for the party’s prospects down the road — the make-or-break province led by an uninspiring figure bereft of the political management skills needed to make the party ‘fighting fit’ for elections. If this leadership takes the party to the polls in the battleground province that can cost it heavily especially as help from the establishment may not be forthcoming this time. The fact thatthe political environment has changed and the public mood has shifted will impose limits on such ‘help’.\nFor the party that has maintained its dominant position in Punjab and arguably has the largest vote bank there, PML-N also confronts challenges it needs to address before getting into election mode. The most significant is to reconcile the ‘divide within’ between two divergent approaches and narratives and also choose whether it wants to pursue a confrontational or conciliatory approach towards the establishment. It has to resolve the dilemma that while its ‘electables’ prefer an accommodating stance voiced by Shehbaz Sharif its voters respond to the hawkish one articulated by Maryam Nawaz, a crowd-puller who has given the party a populist aura. If confusion continues on this count, it would be costly for a party otherwise adept at constituency politics.\nFactionalism is another serious problem. This continues to sap its organisational cohesiveness and may have contributed to the fact that in by-elections its candidates won by smaller majorities with rivals polling more votes than previously. As much of Punjab politics still revolves around biradaris, unless the party contains biradari-based factionalism, in-fighting would open the way for rivals to reap the electoral advantage with PTI as the main beneficiary.\nThe PPP has to decide whether, as in the last election, it wants to focus principally on its traditional stronghold in rural Sindh to retain control of the province, and south Punjab, or have a countrywide approach. In the past it has predicated its strategy on local seat adjustments beyond Sindh which yielded limited results. But recent organisational changes in central Punjab after the Khushab by-election setback may leave the party in a weaker position in a region where the party lost many local influentials to PTI in the last election and then was wiped out there.\nBeyond each party’s challenges and choices, two interrelated trends are likely to continue: a regionalised outcome, with different parties forming governments in the provinces and a coalition government at the centre. That has wider implications for governance but in the near term it implies that political leaders will need to reach out to others ahead of time to forge alliances or understandings to enhance their chances of forming a coalition."}]}

Fast-moving events on the ground are outpacing efforts to ensure an orderly transition to a post-America political dispensation there. Intense uncertainty clouds the country’s future as concern grows in Pakistan and elsewhere about the increasing danger of its slide into chaos. Prime Minister Imran Khan’s comments in an interview last week are the latest expression of those fears.\nWhile the US pullout is proceeding ahead of schedule the Afghan peace process remains in a state of deadlock and there is a significant surge in violence. Another complicating factor injected into an already fraught situation is the cooling in relations between Islamabad and Kabul.\nRead:The danger in Afghanistan\nThere is no indication that the US-orchestrated international peace conference in Istanbul aimed to accelerate the intra-Afghan dialogue will take place anytime soon. The UN was supposed to convene the meeting in late April but efforts to persuade the Taliban to attend have so far come to naught.\nWhile the political stalemate continues, the US withdrawal has picked up pace. There are credible reports that Washington wants to accelerate the withdrawal to mitigate the risk to its troops and complete the pullout by early or mid-July rather than the September deadline announced by President Joe Biden. Nato forces are also said to be working on a July deadline with the drawdown proceeding accordingly.\nThe spectre that looms is of chaos and more strife with grave implications for Pakistan.\nThis should lend urgency to diplomatic efforts for peace talks to make progress towards a political settlement. So far, despite some interaction between the Afghan negotiating delegations in Doha, the intra-Afghan process has all but come to a halt. What has not ceased is fighting between Afghan National Security Forces and the Taliban. Violence has intensified and US airpower has had come to the aid of ANSF in several places especially in the south. US/Nato air support remains critical to Kabul’s ability to withstand rising military pressure from the Taliban, who have however abided — so far — by the agreement not to attack foreign forces.\nUS and Pakistani efforts to persuade the Taliban to agree to a reduction in violence have met with little success. Washington sought this as a necessary accompaniment to the peace plan it outlined a few months ago. But the Taliban offensive has made it evident that they are not prepared to give up an option that aims to bolster their negotiating position and test Kabul’s strength. Their stance remains that the reduction of violence and a ceasefire have to emerge from intra-Afghan talks and not before. Hopes that by the beginning of June some reduction of violence would be achieved remain unfulfilled, for now.\nA top Pakistani official has been in Doha to persuade the Taliban to show flexibility and resume the intra-Afghan dialogue and reduce violence. But the Taliban don’t seem to be in a mood to listen at a time when Pakistan’s leverage has been diminishing. The Taliban have been urged to put their peace plan on the table, but again, there is no sign of this. US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is soon expec­ted in the region for another round of shuttle diplomacy in a last-ditch effort to achieve these goals.\nThe Taliban argue that their demands for the release of their prisoners and de-listing from the UN sanctions regime have yet to be met and for which they await a response. They also say that attending a peace conference without knowing what obligations they will be expected to undertake would place them in an unacceptable position. They have reportedly indicated conditional acceptance to join the conference in Turkey provided they know in advance what will happen as they won’t sign up to anything pre-cooked.\nThis may be a pretext to buy time and wait it out for US troops to depart especially as the Taliban see themselves in an ascendent position. Taliban leaders also continue to signal that they will not yield on their insistence that the future Afghanistan should be an Islamic emirate and not a republic. Their position on core issues seems to have hardened as the American withdrawal has entered its end phase. Nevertheless, they continue to want to preserve the international legitimacy they secured since the Doha agreement with the US.\nThis however has not deterred the Taliban from ramping up attacks across the country despite international appeals to de-escalate violence. Their strategy seems to be to encircle provincial capitals and seek to choke several key routes to set the stage for the siege of cities later. Nine districts have already been captured. Defections from Afghan forces at the local level are aiding them in this strategy. The inevitable question this raises is how far ANSF will be able to sustain itself once international forces leave Afghanistan and they are bereft of crucial air cover.\nAgainst this backdrop, the downturn in relations between Islamabad and Kabul has come at a delicate time. Despite Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen ties with President Ashraf Ghani’s government, as reflected most recently in army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa’s May visit to Kabul, two developments have set back relations between the two countries. Gha­ni’s gratuitously provocative remarks against Pak­i­s­­tan in an interview with Der Spiegel and his nat­io­nal security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib’s inc­end­iary comments — just days after Gen Bajwa’s visit.\nThis led to cancellation of a phone conversation planned between Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Ghani. It also put on ice a statement Islamabad was to issue supportive of the Afghan republic’s position on preserving the gains of the last 20 years in Afghanistan and protection of human rights.\nAgainst the backdrop of intensified fighting, lack of movement on a political settlement and the remaining American soldiers packing up to leave, the spectre that looms in Afghanistan is of chaos and more strife and anarchy. This has grave implications for Pakistan who for decades has suffered the destabilising consequences of war, foreign interventions and conflict in its western neighbor. The question now is whether anything can be done to avert a 1989 or 1992 type scenario in Afghanistan, which can have such deleterious repercussions for its long-suffering people and for regional peace and stability."}]}

This ‘shift’ was first announced in March during the ‘Islamabad Policy Dialogue’ organised by the National Security Division and addressed by Pakistan’s political and military leaders.\nAs summarised on a government website this ‘dialogue”’ outlined a ‘new’ policy direction that involved prioritising economic security, changing the “narrative of geopolitical contestation to geoeconomic cooperation”, increasing “Pakistan’s economic footprint globally” and promoting “regional connectivity”. The foreign minister stated several times since that the government is working on transforming the country’s “geopolitics to geoeconomic policy”.\nRead:To achieve success at geoeconomics, Brand Pakistan must capture the imagination of the global business press and investment community\nIf these assertions mean that Pakistan will henceforth subordinate its geostrategic aims to strengthening its economy and reorient foreign policy to serve the country’s domestic economic interests and promote growth and prosperity then it is a welcome shift. However, any policy shift must have substance and clarity otherwise it remains a declaration of intent. As these official statements have yet to be elaborated or specify the means by which the policy is to be pursued, the ‘shift’ is, for now, a desire not a strategy.\nConceptual and operational clarity is essential before announcing a policy change as is its timing. It is questionable how geoeconomics will be separated from geopolitics as the two are interrelated. Moreover, at a time when Pakistan is confronted with more than one geopolitical storm — regional and global — how exactly will the country negotiate geopolitical challenges while pivoting to geoeconomics? Afghanistan is at an inflection point facing the growing danger of descending into chaos with serious ramifications for Pakistan’s security. Relations remain tense and unpredictable with India which continues on a repressive course in occupied Kashmir with demographic changes and further bifurcation of the state looming, which is bound to further inflame the situation. US-China confrontation is casting a shadow over the region posing a challenge for Islamabad that wants to avoid getting into its crosshairs but may find that a tough balancing act. Thus, geopolitics and Pakistan’s security dilemmas cannot be wished away by declarations alone. A new strategy or policy shift has to be matched to reality. More on this later.\nA policy shift must be backed by substance otherwise it is a statement of intent not a strategy.\nWhat is really meant by geoeconomics? The international literature on this is instructive. There is little agreement on how to define geoeconomics with the term used in different ways. Definitions include the geostrategic use of economic power, using “economic tools to advance geopolitical objectives”, achievement of foreign policy outcomes by economic, not military, power projection, and “use of economic instruments to promote and defend national interests, and produce beneficial geopolitical results”. Some see geoeconomics as a form of statecraft that deploys geopolitical power and leverages geography to achieve economic ends.\nEdward Luttwak, a US strategic thinker, first forged the term geoeconomics in 1990 in the Cold War’s aftermath. He argued that commerce was displacing military power as a tool for countries to deploy with geoeconomics emerging as an “admixture of the logic of war with the methods of commerce”. Building on previous scholarly works, the book War by other Means by Robert Blackwill and Jennifer Harris contributed to the global debate on the rising role of geoeconomics in the international arena by examining the means adopted by the US, China and others to accomplish foreign policy goals. More and more states they wrote “are waging geopolitics with capital, attempting with sovereign checkbooks and other economic tools to achieve strategic objectives that were in the past the stuff of military coercion or conquest”.\nIn a recent book titled Geoeconomics and Power Politics in the 21st Century, one of its writers points out that geoeconomics has not entirely replaced military means of statecraft. Both instruments coexist and are deployed by countries depending on what they consider appropriate for the challenges they confront. The book emphasises that in making use of economic tools the factors that count in geoeconomic strategies include markets, resources, and ability to control and direct investment to compete effectively.\nAlmost all the recent literature identifies China as the world’s leading exponent and “practitioner of geoeconomics”. With ample justification. China’s Belt and Road Initiative is the biggest and most ambitious geoeconomic enterprise of this century. Encompassing over 70 countries and engaging 138 states it aims to build land and maritime networks involving infrastructure, power projects and telecommunications to promote trade and resource flows, achieve economic integration and boost economic growth and development. In Africa and Latin America, Chinese influence has expanded through targeted investments giving it unprecedented strategic outreach.\nGeoeconomics has been successfully pursued not just by big powers but smaller and medium-sized countries too. The crucial and obvious requirement is domestic economic strength and resources. Does Pakistan have the economic attributes regarded as prerequisites to pursue a geoeconomic policy? The most fundamental requirement is a strong economy. With an economy perpetually burdened by crises in public finance caused by chronic budget and balance of payments deficits, Pakistan has yet to seriously address these structural problems to achieve sustainable growth. A narrow tax base and failure to mobilise domestic resources has inevitably meant growing indebtedness and reliance on frequent IMF bailouts. A limited and undiversified export base plus lack of innovation has also prevented the country from becoming a player in global markets and economy.\nTherefore, if Pakistan wants to pursue a geoeconomics policy in any meaningful way it has to transform its economy, ensure a stable political environment and reorder its internal priorities and budget allocations. Economic power and capability cannot be ‘borrowed’ or ‘imported’ from outside but built at home by undertaking long postponed structural reforms. The essential ingredients of a strong economy are internal.\nIf by geoeconomics the government means leveraging the country’s location to become a regional hub that vision has been projected by every government since the 1990s. It was never realised because of regional geopolitical tensions and the country’s weak economic fundamentals. And that too requires a strong economic foundation including efficient and attractive markets.\nNo country can talk its way into effecting a policy shift. Unless it is backed by substance and reflects reality it remains a vision on paper, not in practice."}]}

The visit turned out to be more about containing China than other issues on the global agenda. The US president used the trip to build support among America’s Western allies to counter China.\nThe meeting of the Group of Seven in Cornwall, the 30-member Nato summit and even the first US-EU summit saw much of the focus on China. During the G7 parleys the US pressed European countries to join it to censure Beijing on several counts including human rights and trade practices. Dialling up pressure on Beijing evoked a strong response from Chinese officials who accused the G7 of slandering their country’s reputation and declared that “the days when global decisions were dictated by a small group of countries are long gone”.\nDifferences between US & European allies on China will not constrain America from a confrontational path.\nEven as the G7 tackled a slew of issues ranging from Covid-19 vaccines to climate change and global economic recovery it was China that seemed to dominate the agenda. This was evident from the communiqué as well as announcement of an ostensible answer to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that envisages raising private capital for infrastructure projects in developing nations. Biden set the tone by framing the competition with China as a ‘contest’ between Western democracies and autocrats and urging G7 countries to harden their position on Beijing. As a result, the communiqué assailed Beijing on human rights in Xinjiang, called for greater autonomy for Hong Kong and demanded an investigation into the origins of Covid-19 in China.\nRead:Rare earth metals lie at heart of China’s rivalry with US, Europe\nWriting inThe Guardian, Rafael Behr portrayed “Biden’s mission” in Cornwall as an effort “to recruit allies for the next cold war”. Whether or not a new cold war is an apt description, Biden’s anti-China diplomacy seemed to go into overdrive. This became more obvious at the American president’s next stop in Brussels for the Nato summit, where the stance got even tougher.\nThe communiquéissuedafter Nato’s annual summit pronounced China as a security challenge and declared that China’s “stated ambitions and assertive behaviour” that included building a nuclear arsenal and space and cyber warfare capabilities “present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order”. Chinese officialsshot back to furiously denounce the communiquéfor the China threat theory and portrayed it as being the “continuation of a Cold War mentality”.\nDriving this hardline US approach is its growing fear of a rival superpower’s increasing global economic, military and technological power. It reflects the political and popular consensus in the US — fuelled by years of former president Trump’s actions and rhetoric — that sees China as an adversary who has to be contained rather than engaged. Recently the White House’s top official for Asia asserted that the “the period that was broadly described as engagement has come to an end”. Kurt Campbell, coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs also said that US policy towards China will now be pursued within a “new set of strategic parameters” in which “the dominant paradigm is going to be competition”.\nThe latest act in this competition was G7’s unveiling of a US orchestrated infrastructure plan — billed as a “Green” development initiative — to challenge China’s BRI, the biggest and most ambitious economic enterprise of this century. The ‘Build Back Better for the World’ initiative was however long on rhetoric and short on specifics. No details were forthcoming either about its scope or funding. This left it open to question whether it would materialise at the scale envisioned. There was also a touch of irony in the fact that while the US was rolling out a global infrastructure plan the administration had failed to get its domestic infrastructure legislation approved by Congress.\nThe two key questions raised by Biden’s Europe trip are how far European allies will be willing to go beyond tough words and sign up to an adversarial policy with China and what is the outlook for the future course of US-China relations. With some exceptions most European allies are sceptical about a confrontational policy especially as they have key economic equities in ties with China. Last year China became the EU’s top trading partner surpassing the US. Germany’s top export market and biggest trading partner happens to be China, which is why Chancellor Angela Merkel once said that EU and US interests on China are “not identical”. Italy is part of BRI and is reported to have agreed with Merkel during the G7 summit that action against China should be avoided.\nOther than perhaps France and Belgium, most EU countries prefer a more measured approach to China. Washington’s closest ally, UK may also be reluctant to adopt too antagonistic a policy especially as it wants to expand trade and investment with China. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was quoted as saying when he arrived for the Nato summit that “When it comes to China, I don’t think anybody wants to descend into a new cold war.”\nDifferences between the US and its Western allies on China policy will not however constrain Washington from pursuing the path it has chosen. Turbulence in Sino-US ties will persist as competition intensifies between them. Cooperation will nonetheless be sought in limited areas of common interest — such as climate change. But volatility is inescapable when there is unmanaged competition and an explicit ‘adversarial’ dimension in US policy.\nCan the relationship be stabilised? A prudent response to this has been offered by a Chinese academic in an article inForeign Affairstitled ‘New engagement consensus’. Professor Wang Dong argues that a new cold war is neither inevitable nor desirable. He proposes a new approach to engagement involving strategic reassurance among other things. China, as a rising power, would need to credibly reassure Washington that “it is neither pursuing a sphere of influence by pushing the US out of East Asia” nor aiming to replace the existing international order”. The US for its part would have to “resist pursuing a containment strategy and seeking to mobilise the US public and its allies for a new cold war”. Whether this sensible advice will be heeded remains an open question."}]}

A truce was eventually reached between the government and opposition only to be breached a few days later when some lawmakers again reverted to conduct unbecoming.\nRead:Fistfights, profanities mar National Assembly session\nThis triggered considerable debate on television and comment in the social media. Much of this assumed a partisan nature. It was said this wasn’t the first time parliament had seen such a fracas and mayhem. Examples were cited of the past as also of brawls in the legislatures of other countries. But this missed the point. Past uncivil behaviour doesn’t make it any more acceptable today. Nor does the breakdown in norms and civility elsewhere mean that it is alright to repeat the same conduct here.\nMembers of parliament have a responsibility to the people who elected them; to do the job for which their constituents have sent them to the legislature. They have a responsibility to the country’s taxpayers too. After all it is taxpayers’ money that pays for their salaries and the many perks they enjoy. Therefore, they also have a responsibility to the country, not just to their political constituency.\nOf course, it is the deepening political polarisation in the country which often drives unparliamentary conduct. The unrestrained and intemperate language used by many MPs is a reflection of this as well as the dominant political culture that sees the ethic of war — to subdue the ‘enemy’ — rather than the ethic of competition as their guiding ‘principle’. This rules out efforts to engage rivals or show them any respect.\nUnseemly conduct by members of the National Assembly has political costs for all sides.\nWhat gets lost in this deeply polarised environment is the obligation to work parliament in the public interest. If parliament’s role is to legislate, debate and inform, then disorderly behaviour is tantamount to a dereliction of duty and responsibility. Political leaders and members of the assemblies never cease to declare their commitment to parliament’s supremacy, but these claims sound hollow coming from those who engage in rowdy behaviour on the floor of the House.\nThe Senate has demonstrated more sobriety in the conduct of its business. Debates in the Upper House are often substantive. Several members of the National Assembly have also been diligent in their work and have acted with dignity. But the behaviour of some of their colleagues in the Lower House has been anything but civil.\nIt is the majority party that sets the substance and tone for parliamentary activity. Thus, its attitude is fundamental for the smooth — and peaceful — functioning of the Assembly. But if the treasury benches and their leadership regard all those sitting on opposition benches as venal politicians who should be in jail rather than parliament that makes for a charged environment. It also obviates efforts to elicit the cooperation needed to carry out parliament’s actual functions.\nMoreover, if the ruling party treats parliament as a means only to maintain the government in power rather than as an instrument of governance this has a bearing on parliament’s functioning. Its role as a forum to initiate and shape laws, articulate and debate policy is left diminished. When the leader of the House barely comes to parliament this not only signals lack of interest but also sets an example for senior ministers to routinely skip attending the Assembly.\nLawmaking by executive fiat also marginalises parliament’s role. The PTI government has relied more on promulgating ordinances for its legislative agenda than legislating by parliament. It may be following an inglorious tradition but it has now beaten the record of two predecessor governments in issuing ordinances, according to an assessment by Pildat. The great value of parliamentary debate is that it mobilises consensus, builds legitimacy for government measures and galvanises support for its policies. Lawmaking by ordinance denudes the government of these benefits and prevents wider ownership of laws that are decreed in this manner or rushed through parliament without discussion.\nThe opposition too has an obligation to participate with earnestness in parliamentary proceedings. But the major opposition parties have not engaged in a sustained or consistent way in the Assembly. They have often swung between boycotts, walkouts, disruptive actions and even threats to resign from membership. The opposition should use parliament as a forum to articulate policy alternatives and present solutions to national problems in addition to subjecting government measures to critical scrutiny. Irrespective of how treasury benches act, opposition members can seize the initiative by proposing legislation, initiate debate on key issues and vigorously perform the function of oversight of executive actions.\nOn occasion this has happened but not often enough. Significantly, female lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have made a greater contribution in terms of agenda setting and attendance according to a recent Fafen report. Some of the NA committees have also taken their role seriously, often due to the interest and activism of individual members rather than their party’s directives.\nThere is another reason for the diminished role of parliament as a debating chamber. 24/7 television news channels with their proliferation of talk shows have increasingly become the main platform for political debate. Appearing on television gives instant, high visibility, and is therefore prioritised over Assembly attendance by most political leaders. This affects parliament’s deliberative role. Media engagement is of course essential in politics today but that should not mean lawmakers treat television appearances as a substitute for parliamentary duties.\nIt is the unseemly behaviour witnessed recently — not for the first time — that is the most unedifying aspect of many members’ participation in parliament. This entails political costs for all sides. While members indulging in this may think this plays to their political base, and arguably pleases their leadership, it does nothing to earn the respect of the public at large. The conduct of parliamentarians matters and unseemly conduct has consequences for how they are perceived by people. If anything, it generates public disillusionment and brings parliament into disrepute. Not only is the Lower House’s credibility eroded but democracy too is debased."}]}

Policy formulation and policy articulation both require careful thought and judgement. How policy is publicly articulated can make it more or less effective and impact on relations with other countries. In diplomacy it is essential to know when not to publicly say something and when to speak. Words have consequences, intended or unintended. Words on foreign policy can affect — for good or ill — Pakistan’s diplomatic relations, how the world sees us and international opinion. As no line separates what is spoken for domestic consumption and what is heard abroad it is important to carefully weigh words and be judicious in making foreign policy assertions.\nThese considerations seem to have been ignored in foreign policy statements and interviews by the government’s top leaders, causing unnecessary confusion and slip-ups, which are unhelpful for the country. For a start, too many PTI ministers, whose portfolios are unrelated to foreign affairs, voice public views on international issues often at variance with what their colleagues are saying. Consider the recent FATF meeting. At least three ministers in addition to the foreign minister commented on its outcome. One minister even said Pakistan’s retention on the ‘grey list’ was due to its nuclear status! This isn’t the only issue on which differing voices have been heard. At a perilous moment in Afghanistan whose fate involves serious implications for Pakistan some ministers have been airing views which don’t necessarily accord with official policy.\nRead:FM Qureshi must learn that discretion is the art of diplomacy\nConsistency in official pronouncements is essential so that clarity in policy is conveyed which leaves no room for doubt about Pakistan’s interests and goals and position on specific issues. But this aim is compromised when those holding other portfolios mount the airwaves with little knowledge and only to seek publicity.\nEven those responsible for articulating foreign policy should consider if speaking too often — a presser or TV appearance every day — is prudent or productive. Making daily statements minimises their significance. It also heightens the risk of making mistakes and gaffes that result in avoidable embarrassment. This is evident from the frequency with which remarks by some ministers have had to be clarified or disavowed. Wise political leaders strike a balance between raising their profile and engaging in overexposure. This also applies to those with foreign policy responsibilities. Some explanations are best left to spokespersons.\nWhining is not a strategy and enunciation of foreign policy should not be subservient to populist politics.\nAnother aspect to enunciation of foreign policy by the government has to do with its populist politics and the seemingly irresistible compulsion to play to the public gallery. This phenomenon is also evidenced in other countries where populism holds sway. Of course, it is important to explain policy to the public and build national consensus on foreign policy goals and initiatives. But that is quite different from making bombastic or provocative pronouncements aimed only at the local audience, which have direct implications for Pakistan’s ties with other countries.\nAgain, playing to the gallery is neither new nor exclusive to Pakistani leaders. But like elsewhere, it creates avoidable problems and complications. A populist approach to foreign policy that involves excessive recourse to statements designed to appeal to people’s emotions at home can end up with the country being. perceived abroad as unpredictable and non-serious in its international dealings. Casting aspersions or attributing malign motives to erstwhile friendly countries hardly helps to advance the country’s goals. What is said to a local audience resonates abroad and is consequential.\nAnother tendency of some ministers is to publicly criticise, even castigate, an otherwise friendly country or multilateral body when they are not supportive of Pakistan’s position. At times an assessment reached in in-house discussions — that should stay in-house — is publicly voiced. An example ispublic criticismof the OIC not long ago. The question is whether a public attack, rather than privately conveying misgivings and mounting pressure, will urge an organisation or country to change course? Or will a public rebuke further reinforce their position?\nThis also happened with a state with whom Pakistan has a crucial relationship and resulted in a setback that took a year to rectify. The most recent case in point concerns a multilateral body, FATF. For senior ministers to publicly denounce it for being politically motivated — a view that may be well-founded — is not the way to elicit a positive future outcome from that body. Predictably it prompted a European official (speaking anonymously) to caution Islamabad against making such statements which “were not only counterproductive but also harmful for Pakistan’s interests”. This is not to say that disagreement with statements or reports should not be voiced but it must be done in a purposeful and measured way.\nThe tone of foreign policy statements sends important signals abroad. Whining is not a strategy. Whining about a decision or lack of international response on an issue of importance to Pakistan will not change the minds of others. But it will expose the country’s frustrations and vulnerabilities to its adversaries. Moreover, a constantly complaining tone is self-denigrating and tiresome for others. Whining only advertises weakness and does nothing to enhance Pakistan’s reputation. Even worse are statements that give an impression of playing victim — a helpless target of ‘international conspiracies’ or unfair policies of others. Again, such sentiments even if justified, are best raised in private because playing victim shows a lack of self-confidence.\nA penchant to keep invoking the past and lament how the country was (mis)treated in a relationship has also been evidenced. This is fine for internal assessments about the historical context of a bilateral relationship but it seems pointless to go on and on about it in public speeches. It signals an inability to get past the past and equally the lack of meaningful thinking about the future. Narratives predicated on public lamentations are neither helpful in rebuilding a relationship nor do they mobilise public support for any reset.\nPublic enunciation of foreign policy in a coherent, confident and dignified way is an essential part of statecraft. It should not be made subservient to populist politics or scoring political points at home at the cost of jeopardising Pakistan’s important relationships with other countries or indeed with multilateral organisations."}]}

A throwback to the past with armed power struggles between militias? A protracted civil war? An ascendant Taliban flushed with victory eventually setting up a Taliban government with nominal inclusion of minorities? Or will the Taliban reach out to other Afghan parties for negotiations to forge agreement on their country’s political arrangements and future?\nThe American military withdrawal is nearing completion in what President Joe Biden described in hisend-of-mission addressas a speedier drawdown driven by safety concerns. It has been orderly and so far, casualty-free. This means that the US-TalibanDoha agreementis holding with the Taliban ensuring a peaceful exit. Pakistan has also played a supportive role in facilitating a smooth US pullout through GLOCS (ground lines of communication) and ALOCS (air lines of communication).\nBut as the US drawdown entered its final phase, with 90 per cent now completed, fighting escalated between Afghan government forces and the Taliban. The Taliban have stepped up their offensive and in a series of military assaults overrun andcaptured many districts. Their apparent strategy to secure control of highways and encircle cities has seen a growingmeltdown of government forceswith surrenders by demoralised soldiers across northern Afghanistan that has reinforced their military momentum. Taliban spokesmen claim most districts have been taken by negotiation and without a fight. Having seized areas on the border with China, Iran, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan the Taliban now control the border there with the Afghan government consequently losing their grip over significant parts. Taliban representatives have however sought to reassure anxious neighbours that they pose no threat to the region.\nDiplomatic efforts aimed at intra-Afghan negotiations that had stalled in Doha have been overtaken by fast-moving developments on the ground. Attention has turned to when the Taliban will likely mount an assault on Kabul and whether the ANSF would be able to hold them off for any length of time. Assessments vary about the fall of the Afghan government. Although President Biden has said a Taliban takeover is not inevitable, a much-cited US intelligence assessment concluded it could be as early as six months. Reduced US air support for Afghan forces may contribute to this. Pakistan’s assessment is that Kabul could hold out beyond six months.\nThere is still time for collective diplomatic action to avert a chaotic outcome in Afghanistan.\nThe Taliban themselves have maintained a meaningful silence on this. Instead, they have announced they plan to accelerate the peace process in the coming month and present awritten peace proposal. Their spokesman declared last week that “Although we have the upper hand on the battlefield we are very serious about talks and dialogue”. At a recently convenedmeeting in Moscowa Taliban leader also reiterated the desire for a peaceful settlement.\nThe US, for its part, has warned the Taliban against any military takeover and continued to call for a negotiated settlement. A State Department spokesmansaidearlier this month that “The world will not accept the imposition by force of a government in Afghanistan. Legitimacy and assistance for any Afghan government can only be possible if that government has a basic respect for human rights”. Meanwhile, in response to a question, President Biden stated bluntly that the US would not be responsible if the Taliban took over militarily or if civil war broke out.\nThe key question now is whether the international community can still act to encourage the Taliban and other parties to pursue a negotiated settlement. While Biden said it was time for “determined diplomacy” for peace he did not spell out what this meant other than reiterate that it was up to Afghans to decide their own destiny. Though time is running out there is still a narrow, but fast-closing window for collective action. The most immediate need is for regional states and big powers to desist from arming the warring Afghan sides and to strictly implement a policy of non-interference in this regard. A joint declaration to this effect should be considered. Anything less will fuel a civil war worse than that witnessed in the 1990s which will only compound the suffering of the Afghan people who yearn for peace and order.\nEditorial:Misunderstanding Afghanistan\nBeyond this, the extended Troika — US, China, Russia and Pakistan — plus Iran (who will need some persuasion) should consider mounting collective pressure on the Afghan parties to encourage them to work for an orderly transition to an interim government. Some would argue it is too late for this. But there is time for a last-ditch effort to avoid a chaotic outcome. Far better than simply watching the situation unravel or issuing platitudinous statements. No country has enough leverage individually but collectively deployed leverage might influence the parties to be responsive.\nThe Troika plus Pakistan and Iran could offer a package of incentives to help spur intra-Afghan talks towards a settlement. This can include three elements. One, an assurance to lend legitimacy to such an outcome especially as the Taliban would want to reinforce, not lose, the international recognition they won with the Doha agreement. Two, an offer to begin the process of delisting of individuals and entities from the UN’s sanctions regime; this was promised to the Taliban by the Doha accord in return for entering intra-Afghan talks. And three, the assurance of international economic assistance which the next government in Kabul will need to rebuild a war-ravaged country. Holding out the promise of a peace dividend should also aim to mobilise public pressure on the Afghan parties not to squander an opportunity for peace and stability.\nPakistan should encourage an early meeting of representatives of the extended Troika countries even if it is convened virtually to issue a no-arms supply and non-interference declaration as well as agree on a package of incentives to place before the Afghan parties. Let it not be said that diplomacy failed the people of Afghanistan who have already suffered so much through decades of war, turmoil and strife. And let history not judge that Afghanistan and the region all lost the peace."}]}

But in an age of verbal excess and fake news the language and political narratives deployed by some of the country’s politicians flout the basic norms of civility. Politics has never been polite in Pakistan. But the political culture today has sunk to new depths of incivility. Statements by some political leaders and spokespersons not only routinely fail the truth test but are offensive and irresponsible. Often statements aimed at vilifying a political opponent say more about the person mouthing them than the target. Those making such utterances get the intended media play but show utter disregard for the deleterious political consequences of what they say.\nConsider for example the bitter invective being exchanged in the electioncampaign in Azad Kashmir. The focus is not on what parties have to offer voters in terms of policy. Nor is there any debate on governance issues. The accent is mainly on negative campaigning that aims to malign and disparage political opponents. Also, the emphasis is not just on alleging that others have done a disservice to the people of Azad Kashmir but accusing them of “selling out occupied Kashmir” to benefit the country’s adversary. Allegations of treachery have repeatedly been levelled at one another.\nAn opposition leader accused the prime minister of being complicit in the Indian government’s August 2019 action of illegally annexing occupied Jammu and Kashmir. Equally false was a PTI leader’s claim that none of the previous prime ministers had ever mentioned Kashmir in their UN speeches. Federal government ministers also accused leaders of the two rival parties of everything from being traitors and ‘dacoits’ to criminals. A minister reputed for employing coarse language went so far as to use innuendos of the basest kind against an opposition leader. Later he wasbarredby the AJK election commission from participating in any election related activity there.\nThe verbal duel also reverberated in the Senate with harsh words exchanged between the treasury and opposition benches when PPP members protested the use of insulting language by that minister. Parliament echoed with who-is-a-patriot rhetoric.\nFalse allegations and intemperate language foster a toxic culture in which uncivil conduct is ‘mainstreamed’.\nAll this may not be new to Pakistan’s politics. Like elsewhere in the world, it has always had a seamy side. For instance, politics in the 1990s witnessed a good deal of name-calling, character assassination, and accusations of disloyalty to the country with top leaders being dubbed as ‘security risks’. But as that preceded the era of independent television networks and social media the most vitriolic attacks were mostly filtered out by the print media. Today they are amplified by the plethora of news platforms and go viral on social media. They therefore reach more people and nourish a toxic political culture in which such conduct is ‘mainstreamed’ and deemed acceptable.\nThe impact on the wider public is predictable. People are left wondering whether their erstwhile representatives have any public interest issues on their agenda if all they do is direct hate speeches against each other. In the campaign rhetoric in Azad Kashmir where everyone is being accused of betraying the Kashmir cause what kind of message is being sent to the long-suffering people of occupied Kashmir? That no leader, no party believes in the cause and that all Kashmir for them is a political football to be kicked around for narrow political gain or electoral advantage?\nThen there is rhetoric used by some political leaders that illustrates how thoughtlessly they make certain claims. Among such utterances last week was this by a senior minister, as translated from Urdu: only the army and PTI are ‘national’. This means one of two things. Either they are the only ones representative of the entire country or only they are patriotic. In either case is this something a minister (who has been a member of parties he now attacks) should say? If he meant all others except the ruling party lack national spirit that implies that almost two-thirds of voters who did not support the ruling party are ‘unpatriotic’. This denigrates not just political opponents but the majority of people and the country itself as most of its citizens are cast as unpatriotic. The notion that those who do not support the ruling party are unpatriotic is at the very least disingenuous.\nRead:The mediocrity of political banter\nWhen political debate is reduced to a shouting and bullying match — on daily display on television screens — the space for any reasoned discussion is eliminated. All too often TV audiences hear assertions made by some politicians that defy the truth but are voiced in the belief that repeated often enough these assertions will start acquiring credibility.\nThis conduct has many pernicious effects on the country’s political system and culture. For a start such bitter confrontation laced with incendiary rhetoric only sharpens political polarisation that in turn weakens political institutions and renders the political system almost dysfunctional. A degree of mutual tolerance and restraint is necessary to make the political system work. It is in the government’s interest to lower the political temperature and establish a less fraught environment. But it has chosen not to do so.\nThat has made the political consensus necessary to address national challenges elusive, to the detriment of the country. Divisiveness has been engendered, not unity. Pakistan’s external and internal challenges require consensus over policy measures needed to tackle them, but combative politics that rests on defaming the other rules out even minimal agreement. When insults become the principal political weapon the culture that is spawned is one permeated by toxic and often untruthful narratives and norm-breaking behaviour.\nThis type of conduct by public representatives evokes public disdain not least because constant and excessive targeting of political opponents conveys the impression that politics is only a power struggle disconnected from issues of public concern. Loss of public respect follows. Politics and politicians come into disrepute. And ultimately public faith in democracy itself is eroded when the practitioners of democracy are seen to relentlessly engage in conduct unbecoming."}]}

This did not mean the two parties had even started negotiations on substantive issues. For that reason, the meeting was a disappointment. But the statement did mark a modest step forward in outlining principles to guide them towards a peaceful solution. It affirmed the goal of a negotiated and inclusive settlement and vowed to protect the civilian infrastructure, prevent civilian casualties and cooperate on humanitarian assistance. Both sides also committed to remain “engaged in negotiations at a senior level until a settlement is reached”.\nHowever, lack of discussion of substantive issues laid bare the yawning gap between the two sides, who continue to maintain maximalist positions and have shown little willingness to compromise. The Taliban apparently made substantive negotiations contingent on release of their prisoners and delisting of their leaders and entities from the UN’s sanctions list — their immediate priorities. The Kabul delegation’s call for a ceasefire was turned down by the Taliban as was an apparent proposal for an interim government, whose details were not however spelt out. Later, Taliban spokesman and member of the negotiating team Suhail Shaheensaidthey would agree to a ceasefire only when a “new negotiated government” was installed. He too did not elaborate on what that involved other than President Ashraf Ghani’s removal.\nThe inconclusive round of talks in Doha raises afresh the question of whether the peace process can make meaningful progress at a time when the Taliban are on the ascendent while Kabul’s representatives doggedly stick to their positions and President Ghani appears increasingly isolated within his own government. As the Taliban are now in a far stronger position, a key question is whether they are simply playing for time in the talks as they continue with their military offensives and seize more territory.\nDespite the Taliban’s military advance the window is still open for diplomatic efforts to promote a political settlement.\nThere seem to be two views of this in Pakistan — probably mirroring similarly divided opinion among the international community. The first is that the Taliban are not interested in serious negotiations until they take control of the country. Only then will they offer talks from a position of uncontested power and on their terms. The other view is that the Taliban are aware of the risk they run in going for a military takeover — losing international legitimacy and the recognition they secured after the Doha agreement with the US. Therefore, they would want to explore through the intra-Afghan process whether they can achieve their objectives by negotiations rather than military force.\nThe Taliban’s statements lend plausibility to the second view even though this will be tested in Doha in the weeks ahead. In hismessagebefore Eid the Taliban’s supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada declared that in spite of military gains he “strenuously favours” a political settlement. In similar vein, a Taliban spokesman toldCNNthat “a military takeover is not an option” for them. The Taliban have of course been repeatedly warned by the international community not to impose a military solution. The international consensus, which includes Pakistan, is opposed to such an outcome. In any case, until the Taliban gain unchallenged control of the country the window for diplomatic efforts, however narrow, will remain open. So long as Afghan government forces do not collapse in the face of the Taliban’s military assaults, diplomacy will have a chance.\nSo, how should the international community take advantage of this window? How can the Doha talks be made to move beyond tactical issues towards substance? Clearly a concerted effort is needed by the international community to press both parties to negotiate seriously before time runs out and a fully blown civil war erupts. So far diplomatic efforts aimed at promoting this objective have been fragmented with different countries initiating separate efforts towards this aim. This is illustrated by recent talks hosted by Iran and earlier by Russia and the proliferation of ‘tripartite’ groups on this count. It is now urgent for a unified initiative that mounts pressure on both Afghan parties to make the admittedly difficult compromises to reach a negotiated settlement.\nRead:The new Afghanistan challenge\nThe best vehicle for this is the extended Troika comprising the US, China, Russia and Pakistan. The Troika has held three meetings since October 2020, one of them virtually and the last one in May. The joint statement issued then reiterated that there is “no military solution in Afghanistan and a negotiated political settlement through an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process is the only way forward for lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan”. The US is reported to be in favour of calling a meeting. This was apparently conveyed to Islamabad by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad when hevisited Pakistanlast week. China and Russia have to be consulted, but they should be supportive.\nThe extended Troika also needs to encourage Iran to join it in a renewed diplomatic push. Tehran is apparently reluctant if Washington leads it. In fact, Pakistan should host and lead it at this critical juncture and invite Iran to join in. It can also explore co-hosting this with the UN if that helps to bring in Iran. If this meeting can be convened the extended Troika plus Iran can collectively exert pressure on the Afghan sides to accelerate efforts for a political settlement. In so doing, both incentives (international legitimacy, delisting and future assistance) and disincentives (withholding recognition, assistance) should be laid out to goad the two sides towards serious negotiations, underlining that time is now their common enemy.\nThe alternative to a diplomatic push is the Afghan ground situation dictating a messy outcome. With militias being mobilised by warlords to resist the Taliban and the Taliban having “strategic momentum” according to a top US general, what lies ahead is fierce fighting that can plunge Afghanistan into a fully fledged civil war. This is certainly not the outcome regional states and the international community would want. Nor is it one that the long-suffering Afghan people deserve."}]}

Prime Minister Imran Khan reiterated this fear in a recentinterviewwith an American TV network when he said such an outcome would be the “worst-case scenario for the country”.\nPakistan’s security is inextricably tied to Afghanistan. Prolonged strife in its neighbour will expose Pakistan to security threats that it has dealt with in the past at a heavy cost in lives and social and economic consequences. For over four decades Pakistan has borne the brunt of war, foreign military interventions and conflict in Afghanistan that produced grave repercussions for the country’s sec­u­rity, stability and economic development. The des­ta­bilising ramifications are too well known to bear repetition here. More turmoil on its western frontier would mean the country will have to simultaneously deal with internal, regional and international challenges that would flow from this outcome.\nIn a back-to-the-future scenario Pakistan will be faced with a serious threat to its stability if civil war erupts in Afghanistan and spills over into its border areas. Pakistan has sought to mitigate this danger byfencing much of the border, sealing illegal crossing points, increasing border posts, strengthening the capacity of the Frontier Corps, upgrading training of law-enforcement personnel, enhancing technical surveillance and stationing regular troops there. While these measures are necessary, they may not be sufficient to stop the determined from crossing over given the long border and the mountainous terrain and topography.\nMoreover, a chaotic situation across the border will provide fertile ground and more space to a host of militant groups to continue operating from there. The principal but not only threat is from the TTP (the Pakistani Taliban) whose 6,500 members are based in Afghanistan and launch cross-border attacks from there. A reunified TTP has reinforced its capacity. The latest report of the UN’s sanctions monitoring team notes that “the return of splinter groups to the TTP fold has increased its strength”. The TTP’s links continue with the Afghan Taliban, which are acknowledged by Pakistan’s security officials. TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud surfaced rece­ntly to announce in a CNN interview that his militant group will continue its “war against Pakis­tan’s security forces” and its aim is to “take control of the border regions and make them independent”.\nA civil war next door would pose serious threats to Pakistan’s security and multidimensional challenges.\nA surge in violence in North and South Waziristan has led to rising casualties among Pakistani security personnel in recent months. Since May, there have been 167 terrorist incidents in KP and Balochistan, an ominous portent of what could lie ahead. Armed groups residing in Afghanistan would pose a threat to Pakistan with some making common cause with elements who were defeated but dispersed after a series of successful operations by security forces. The UN report says that “a significant part of the Al Qaeda leadership is based along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border” while ISIS-K or Daesh “remains active and dangerous”.\nPakistani military officials have already warned of terrorist sleeper cells being galvanised if there is protracted fighting next door. In Balochistan there could be a further rise in violent activity by revived dissident and other groups orchestrated by hostile foreign intelligence agencies. Thus, Pakistan’s hard-won gains in its counterterrorism campaign could be upended. The prime minister said pointedly in the PBS interview that a civil war in Afghanistan would mean “terrorism in Pakistan”. Also, forces of extremism in the country will take heart and be emboldened by the Taliban’s military success.\nA civil war could also lead to a fresh refugee influx into Pakistan which has hosted three million Afghan refugees for decades now. Pakistani officials worry that fighting will force more Afghans to flee with estimates of new refugees ranging from 500,000 to 700,000. Apart from instituting more effective border controls the government is working on a plan to establish camps near the border to prevent refugees from entering the mainland. Whether the Iranian ‘model’ can work here is open to question especially as tribes are so intertwined on both sides of the border. Using the nomenclature ‘externally displaced Afghans’ to describe them could put at risk international assistance for these refugees as that depends on their refugee status. World Bank funding for refugees too could be in jeopardy.\nRead:Who messed up Afghanistan?\nThen there is the likely economic fallout that Pakistan also experienced in the past. Given how fragile and vulnerable the economy is the shock from a civil war next door and threat of violence at home will jeopardise prospects of growth and investment. This will place Pakistan in a zone of instability which will dampen trade and investment badly needed to achieve economic growth targets. The recent past shows that Pakistan had to bear billions of dollars in economic losses in the aftermath of9/11when the ‘war on terror’ spilled over into the country’s border areas and cities.\nBeyond this, a civil war can lead to a regional proxy war, as it did in the past, but with more damaging consequences and drawing in more countries that perceive threats to their security and are already beefing up their defences. It could turn out to be fiercer than what followed the Russian military withdrawal in the 1990s as neighbours and near neighbours act to protect their interests. More regional states have security concerns now than was the case during Afghanistan’s previous bout of civil war because of transnational armed groups and foreign terrorist fighters who operate from there. They include ETIM, Daesh, IMU, TTP and of course Al Qaeda. There are also fears of fighters in Syria relocating to the region. A proxy war could trigger a reg­ional geopolitical crisis of uncertain proportions.\nAll this may sound alarmist but it is predicated on a worst-case scenario of Afghanistan descending into chaos and civil war. This only underlines the urgency of regional and international diplomatic efforts to avert such an outcome. There is time yet for these efforts to make headway. Ultimately however, it will be up to the Afghan parties to make the difficult compromises that can deliver peace to their long-suffering people."}]}

This is understandable as it is the world’s most consequential relationship. China is Washington’s top foreign policy priority. The Biden administration has frequently reiterated this and also said relations with China will have three aspects — adversarial, competitive and cooperative.\nThe twohigh-level exchangesbetween them in Alaska and more recently China, indicate that greater turbulence lies ahead in their relations. After talks in Beijing, Chinese officials described Washington’s “adversarial rhetoric” as a thinly veiled attempt to “suppress and contain China”, adding that relations faced “serious difficulties”. They also cautioned America to not treat China as an “imaginary enemy”.\nMost recent books on the US-China relationship have been written from a Western perspective except one, but more of that later. The very titles of these books are revealing. The World Turned Upside Down by Clyde Prestowitz, How China Loses by Luke Patey and The Long Game: China’s Grand Strategy to Displace American Order by Rush Doshi. The latter is now director for China at America’s National Security Council.\nAll these books see America’s competition with China as this century’s defining dynamic although they reach different conclusions about who will prevail. They also offer policy advice to the Biden team on how to effectively counter China to maintain America’s global dominance. The book that offers a starkly different perspective is by distinguished Singaporean academic and former diplomat Kishore Mahbubani titled Has China Won? The Chinese Challenge to American Primacy. This doesn’t mean he predicts an outcome, which of course depends on several factors and cannot be predetermined.\nThe future course of the world’s most consequential relationship will have far-reaching global ramifications.\nRush Doshi argues that the struggle between the US and China is over who will dominate the regional and global order. China, he says, wants to eclipse America by 2049. In asking whether China has a grand strategy he first defines this. It is how a country pursues its strategic objectives “that is intentional, coordinated, and implemented across multiple means of statecraft — military, economic, and political”. “What makes grand strategy grand is not simply the size of the strategic objectives” but also how disparate “means” are “coordinated together” to achieve them.\nHe claims that China’s grand strategy to displace the American order comprises two elements practised sequentially — first to blunt the hegemon’s control and then build control over other states to secure its predominant position. Doshi describes the third part of the strategy as global expansion which is aimed at displacing the hegemon by using both ‘blunting’ and ‘building’ methods. His argument rests on identifying forms of control that a rising power challenges and then exercises to ensure ascendancy. A hegemon’s position in the regional and global order emerges from three broad “forms of control that are used to regulate the behaviour of other states: coercive capability (to force compliance), consensual inducements (to incentivise it), and legitimacy (to rightfully command it)”.\nDoshi seeks to substantiate his thesis by using Chinese Communist Party texts and their leaders’ speeches among other sources. He devotes separate chapters to China’s military, political and economic strategies in pursuit of its strategic objectives to claim that its leaders “want to restore China to its due place and roll back the historical aberration of the West’s overwhelming global influence”. How should the US respond to this challenge? Doshi rejects both confrontation and accommodation and suggests an “asymmetric competitive strategy” that takes a leaf from China’s own blunting approach.\nRead:America’s China preoccupation\nThe problem with this otherwise interesting book is that it assumes China’s behaviour and objectives mirror those of the US when it was a rising power. It overlooks the civilisational history of a global power that wants to be respected but doesn’t aspire to become a hegemon like other powerful states in history. This is what Mahbubani’s book seeks to explain by offering a persuasive antidote to such assumptions but in a balanced way that identifies strategic mistakes by both global powers.\nThe book poses sharp questions and offers nuanced answers. Does the US have a strategy in its geopolitical competition with China? No, says Mahbubani and argues that America is committing the “classic strategic mistake of fighting tomorrow’s war with yesterday’s strategy” as it is treating the China challenge similar to the old Soviet threat. The US is focusing on military spending (“geopolitical gifts to China”), displaying rigidity in decision-making, draining its power by involvement in military conflicts, and misreading China by erroneously attributing aggressive and expansionist designs to Beijing. All this because groupthink rules in Washington. He is surprised at this because America has the world’s “largest strategic thinking industry”.\nHe argues convincingly that while China wants to “rejuvenate its civilisation” it has no mission to take over the world or recreate it in its image. Despite its growing power China has not intervened in the affairs of other countries. The militarism attributed to it is similarly mistaken because it has never sought to conquer territories as European powers have done and this despite “often being the single strongest civilisation in the Eurasian landmass” for over 2,000 years. China avoids military options and has sought to secure its borders by consolidating relations with neighbouring states. That hardly makes it expansionist. In fact, China’s “primary goal is to preserve peace and harmony” at home, not influence the lives of six billion people who live outside.\nMahbubani’s critique of America’s flawed assumptions is as compelling as his analysis of the strategic mistake China made in “alienating” the US business community (by “squeezing companies”) that could have restrained Washington’s adversarial approach. His conclusion, by his own admission, is paradoxical: the contest between the two “is both inevitable and avoidable”. Even though America has convinced itself that China poses an existential threat yet there are areas of convergence that should urge them towards cooperation. His hope is that if both focus on their core national interest — improving the well-being of their citizens — they will find no contradictions in their long-term interests. Many would share that hope as continuing confrontation between them will have far-reaching global consequences."}]}

These milestones are opportunities to renew the national spirit and inspire hope about the future. They are also occasions to push back against negativity and build national confidence. It is, above all, a moment to recall the vision of Mohammad Ali Jinnah of a liberal, democratic, tolerant and peaceful Pakistan where there is no place for what he called the “poison” of corruption or nepotism, mismanagement and inefficiency. And where women have an equal place in society.\nIntrospection is necessary to not only take stock of where the country is but also review the challenges that remain to be addressed. Multiple challenges emerged over the decades as the cumulative consequence of a complex interplay of internal and external factors. Political disruptions due to military interventions, elite monopolisation of resources and pursuit of dysfunctional economic strategies contributed to governance challenges. So did the blowback from Pakistan’s protracted geopolitical engagements and impact of big power rivalries. External overstretch and internal underreach became a familiar pattern. The ‘tyranny of geography’ imposed heavy burdens. A volatile neighbourhood with contested or unstable borders made security paramount in national priorities but this inevitably involved a trade-off with the country’s development needs.\nA review of the state of play today shows that the glass is both half full and half empty. Five key aspects of the country make it half full although this by no means is an exhaustive list. First, on the political front a firm national consensus and agreement among political actors now exists on the continuance of democracy. The military is part of this consensus even if the army’s influence on national policy looms large. The ‘hybrid’ political system in place today gives the army a role unusual in a democracy but that does not mean military interventions have been legitimised.\nThe second aspect is emergence of forces that are changing power dynamics. They include an energetic media and a more diverse civil society. While under stress today, they are nonetheless powerful vehicles to hold rulers to account. Public opinion is now increasingly important with the media shaping people’s view of government performance. It is also placing limits on governments’ power which is why there are ongoing efforts to stifle media freedom. Such assaults however are being fiercely resisted. Greater citizen activism too is contributing to a transformed political environment and reflects a new sense of public awareness and empowerment.\nThe challenge is to reimagine a Pakistan that meets the needs of its people not just its privileged elites.\nThree, the confluence between rapid urbanisation, shift in the centre of economic power from the countryside to cities and a more ‘connected’ society empowered by modern communications has opened space for transformation of traditional, patronage-based politics. The rise of a larger, more assertive middle class is also a consequence of these factors. Its size may be disputed (estimates range between 50 and 70 million people) but the reality is not. An urban middle class seeking a greater voice in the country’s politics offers opportunities to align Pakistan’s governance system both with changing demographic dynamics and aspirations of a social group whose outlook is different from that found in the stagnant, patrimonial world of traditional politics.\nFour, the greater visibility and growing role of women in many fields of life. Women professionals are making a mark and a difference in many areas and inspiring a younger generation to break more glass ceilings. Rising urban female literacy is driving this change even though rural literacy lags way behind. Of course, women have a long way to go to secure what the Constitution promises and close gender gaps. Violence against women also remains an imposing challenge. But the number of organisations now making women’s voices heard is an encouraging development.\nFive, Pakistan’s youth bulge is an asset — just over 60 per cent are under 30 — with the potential to power a significant leap in development. To reap a demographic dividend this youthful population needs access to education, skills and jobs otherwise a demographic disaster awaits. No account of positive developments is complete without mentioning the flowering of art, music, literature, visual arts and movies witnessed in recent years. This profusion of creative voices has enriched Pakistani culture and is emblematic of a living nation.\nRead:Independence and inter-dependence\nAs to why the glass is half empty the principal reason remains a weak and vulnerable economy burdened by chronic budget and balance-of-payments deficits and growing indebtedness. The structural sources of constant crises in public finance have yet to be addressed. They lie principally in a narrow tax base as reflected in a low and almost stagnant tax-to-GDP ratio. Income tax payers have for years hovered around 3m or less — little over 1pc of the population. A regressive tax regime is in place with indirect taxes accounting for most government revenue. Reliance on domestic and foreign borrowing has landed Pakistan in a classic debt trap where more is borrowed to pay off old debt. The only way to resolve this is by higher investment and growth, both of which have long remained sluggish. A narrow export base compounds Pakistan’s macroeconomic difficulties. Low productivity, lack of innovation and a relatively insular business community remain perennial problems.\nThe country’s education deficit is another reason for the half empty glass. With over 22m school-going children not in school — second highest number in the world — Pakistan needs to urgently address this ‘silent emergency’. Lack of education lies at the heart of almost all challenges confronting the country. It should therefore be seen as an imperative, not just a desirable social goal.\nA third factor is the country’s increasingly dysfunctional politics. This requires little elaboration, characterised as it is by relentless political confrontation, shallow political discourse, lack of consensus on core national goals and failure to accord parliament a key role in democratic governance. Last but not least is growing intolerance in society which also needs little explanation.\nLike other countries Pakistan has both strengths and weaknesses. The challenge is to reimagine a transformed Pakistan that addresses its vulnerabilities, ensures it meets the needs of its people not just its privileged elites, and looks within, not outside, to seize its destiny."}]}

What can be expected under a Taliban government? How is the international community responding to this extraordinary turn of events? And what does it mean for Pakistan?\nThe situation in Afghanistan is in flux so any assessment is necessarily tentative. But first, the much-debated question as to why a 20-year Western project ended in chaos and a political and military collapse. Varying answers have been offered. A key explanation lies in the fact that no dispensation imposed by foreign military intervention outlasts the departure of its patron. This has long been a lesson of history. A 21st-century version of a colonial-style ‘civilising’ mission lay in ruins as the final act of a project plagued by strategic flaws and tactical misjudgements from the very start. What was imposed on Afghanistan by the US-led coalition was a war of retribution — for 9/11 — and not one defined by consistent or realistic objectives.\nThe meltdown of Afghan national security forces represented a collapse of political will — a reminder that more than military training and sophisticated weaponry it is the motivation to fight that counts. An imposed government deeply mired in corruption hardly provided a reason to fight for demoralised and abandoned soldiers. Pakistan’s former army chief Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani had presciently warned US officials over a decade ago that the Afghan army would eventually collapse. Not to be underestimated was the popular yearning for peace which may also explain the lack of armed resistance to the Taliban as that would have involved more bloodshed.\nMost consequential for Pakistan is whether the situation stabilises and peace is established in Afghanistan.\nWhat next for Afghanistan under the Taliban? Again, a much-discussed question is whether their rule will be a throwback to their austere and repressive reign of the 1990s or a break from that dark past. Answers will only emerge with time. For now, the Taliban are keen to dispel the impression that the future will resemble the past, in recognition of the reality that the international environment today is very different from two decades ago.\nIn thefirst press conferenceafter their takeover of Kabul, Taliban spokesmen claimed they would behave differently, having learnt from experience. Pledging no retributory action against those who fought them they also sent a number of messages about how they intend to govern. They vowed to establish an inclusive government, respect human rights and women’s rights and ensure Afghanistan’s soil will not be used against any country.\nThis was aimed to reassure an anxious and sceptical international community. Whether the Taliban live up to these promises remains open to question especially as there are already some indications of relapse into their old ways. Nevertheless, talks between the Taliban and former political foes are in progress to set up a broad-based government. It is to be seen if a political settlement emerges. Many countries are in a wait-and-watch mode and suspending judgement for now. Clearly though, concerted pressure by the global community seems to be working. The Taliban are making reassuring statements in their desire for international legitimacy and recognition. The country’s fragile economic situation must weigh significantly in their calculation especially as dollar reserves are dwindling while the IMF has suspended funding. Without international assistance and trade the economy would simply collapse.\nThe international consensus — as also reflected in the Aug 16 UN Security Council statement with the focus on an inclusive government, respect for human rights and combating terrorism — has sent a common message. It has encouraged the Taliban to adopt a conciliatory stance, in words at least. This means two things. One, engagement is having a moderating effect and two, consensus over key expectations is eliciting assurances from the Taliban. The converse may also hold true. If the international community divides over the recognition issue or there are cracks on other issues this could provide wriggle room to the Taliban to back out of promises. Thus, the need for the multilateral community to engage the Taliban, hold out diplomatic inducements but also sustain collective pressure to ensure promises translate into actions.\nRead:Afghanistan’s future\nTo make good on their promises the Taliban will have to ensure that local commanders abide by their leaders’ decisions. Moreover, mollifying the international community is one thing and living up to public expectations is another. Governing a war-ravaged country will be the real test and an imposing challenge especially as the Taliban have been a warring force, not one adept at governing. Consolidation of power will depend on how well the country is administered, accommodating others as well as addressing the needs of a new generation who are more educated and connected to the outside world.\nIslamabad has long argued that other than Afghanistan, Pakistan has the most to gain from peace in its neighbouring country and the most to lose from more strife and instability. There is understandable relief among officials that bloodshed has been avoided so far. But as the situation is yet to settle Pakistan must move with caution and prudence. In this fluid period Islamabad must stay in lockstep with the international community and coordinate closely on the issue of formal recognition. There is no advantage in going it alone. Diplomatic engagement is in any case continuing and so is cross-border trade. Islamabad is also extending help in intra-Afghan talks aimed at a political settlement. But its involvement should not go beyond this in line with its stated policy that it should be an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led process. Our security forces should also step up border surveillance as a fluid situation can encourage cross-border attacks from militant groups based in Afghanistan that Kabul has yet to act against and on which Islamabad should secure ironclad guarantees.\nAbove all, the government should speak less on an evolving situation and with one voice. There is no reason to sound triumphal, be spokespersons for the Taliban or to keep obsessing about the past. It is the future that should concern us and what is most consequential for the country — whether peace will return to Afghanistan after decades of war, strife and foreign interventions."}]}

A divided opposition in considerable disarray poses little threat. The biggest opposition party PML-N has yet to resolve its identity crisis and is smarting from recent electoral setbacks. The PPP is sporadically active in an opposition role and seems more preoccupied with running its government in Sindh. The depleted opposition alliance PDM, ran out of steam long ago. Its recent meetings have set no direction or created any public impact. Above all, the government retains the establishment’s firm support.\nThe PTI government’s management of the coronavirus pandemic and the vaccination drive have been fairly effective, helped fortuitously by the fact that the virus did not overwhelm the country the way it ravaged neighbouring states. The pandemic is far from over but for now seems under control.\nNone of this means the government can be sanguine about the future especially with its sights set on the general election, just two years away. In Pakistan’s volatile environment political fortunes can shift quickly and consequentially. Moreover, the government has many domestic and foreign policy challenges to navigate as well as governance issues and vulnerabilities to address.\nRead:Tracking Naya Pakistan — Three years into power, here's where PTI stands on some of its promises\nIts most important task is to repurpose its remaining time in office to set a clearer policy direction. If its early years were spent muddling through, the past year has seen the government zero in on several areas but without strategic focus or clear priorities. The problem with being all over the place is that it produces haphazard governance in which ad-hocism rules rather than a well-thought plan that is coherently executed.\nIn Pakistan’s volatile environment political fortunes shift quickly and consequentially.\nThe governance challenge is compounded by an incohesive patchwork cabinet that has underperformed and done little to inspire confidence. This makes it essential to reconfigure the team to match clearly articulated policy priorities. It is time for the prime minister to replace the bloated and jaded cabinet by a new, lean team chosen solely on the basis of competence.\nIn Punjab his team needs a total overhaul. One of the mysteries of the PTI government is why it persists with a provincial leadership that is so weak and lacklustre. Its poor management of the province is already responsible for the ruling party losing significant political ground there. Senior party leaders and allies in Punjab have long wanted a change in provincial leadership especially as they see it as incapable of leading PTI to elections. But the prime minister continues to resist this at great cost to his party even though Punjab is the main battleground in general elections that determines its outcome.\nIt is, however, the economy that will decide the government’s political fortunes. Its economic management record has so far been mixed. A degree of macroeconomic stabilisation has been achieved in spite of economic difficulties wrought by the pandemic. But this is due mostly to multilateral funding from the IMF and others as well as higher remittances from overseas workers. While symptoms have been addressed in this manner causes have not.\nThe structural sources of Pakistan’s chronic financial imbalances have yet to be tackled: a narrow and inequitable tax regime, the energy sector’s circular debt, loss-making public-sector enterprises (reflecting lack of movement on privatisation), a broken public finance management system and the heavy regulatory burden that is impeding productivity and efficiency and hindering investment and growth — essential to deal with debt liabilities. With debt building up to unsustainable levels the only way out of the debt trap is by high growth driven by investment, both of which remain sluggish or stagnant despite official claims.\nIt is inflation that has emerged as the government’s biggest political foe — and challenge. The rising cost of living is the top public priority that emerges in every opinion survey and that people want the government to urgently address. Despite the prime minister’s concern that inflation is eroding public support for his government it is mostly the consequence of official policies: high budget deficit, devaluation and rising utility rates among other factors. Higher oil prices have also contributed. What has exacerbated the situation is poor administrative management that has often resulted in shortages and a spike in prices of essential commodities.\nProviding a cushion for the very poor through an enhanced and expanded Ehsaas programme, which rebranded the Benazir Income Support Programme, has been among the government’s positive initiatives. So has the introduction of a health card in Punjab and KP. Aimed at helping the underprivileged, these programmes have brought credit to the government and have so far been implemented transparently.\nOne of the promises PTI made was to accord priority to civil service reform. Rightly so as strengthening the instrument of governance has become urgent given the erosion of the state’s institutional capacity over time and with that, deterioration in the delivery of public services. But patchwork measures by the government have fallen much short of systemic reform. What is needed is comprehensive and fundamental reform to make the civil service fit for purpose, not tinkering that creates confusion rather than meet the requirements of modern governance.\nOn foreign policy the government’s record has been mixed especially as it has mostly been reactive, lacking strategic focus or imagination. It has also been bereft of real initiatives. The much-touted policy shift from geopolitics to geoeconomics lacks substance, as well as understanding that the two are inseparable. Given that Pakistan is in the eye of more than one geopolitical storm such a ‘shift’ also seems a disconnect from reality. Geoeconomic policies have to rest on a strong domestic economic base which the country lacks at present. As for leveraging Pakistan’s location for ‘regional connectivity’, also envisioned by previous governments, this requires a dissipation of regional geopolitical tensions and strong economic fundamentals, both of which remain elusive today.\nMore importantly, imposing foreign policy challenges lie ahead that will test the Khan government. The uncertain and volatile situation in Afghanistan, a fast-eroding relationship with the US and continuing tensions with India will all require thoughtful and skillful management and smart statecraft that protects the country’s security and advances its interests in an increasingly perilous environment."}]}

In post-America Afghanistan the Taliban face a number of critical tests — of governance, preventing economic collapse, addressing a worsening humanitarian situation and containing terrorist groups that reside there.\nTaliban leaders have to deal with both the urgent and important. The security challenge is among the most urgent because all else is contingent on this even though the multiple challenges they have to negotiate are interconnected and must be tackled simultaneously. The Taliban control more of the country now than they did when they were previously in power. That makes establishing durable order and lasting peace much harder. Thestand-off in Panjsherwith elements of the Northern Alliance has yet to end as talks have apparently failed.\nEditorial:The West must not insist that Afghanistan be remade in its image in order to recognise the Taliban\nPolitical consolidation will obviously depend on how effectively the Taliban are able to govern. After two decades of fighting this is an uphill task especially as the requirements of governance have changed fundamentally since the 1990s, as have people’s expectations. The exodus of hundreds of government employees from the country adds to the governing difficulties.\nThe Taliban will also be under global pressure to deliver on their promise to ensure that Afghan soil is not used to attack other countries. The most important ‘ask’ from the international community is for them to contain if not demobilise violent groups based in Afghanistan. Taliban spokesmen have offered assurances they will not allow their country to be used by these groups. But words have to translate into deeds. The concern of neighbouring states and the wider international community is over the possibility of a permissive environment taking hold which enables these groups to flourish. The Taliban government’s ability to deliver on their commitment will be important to secure international acceptability.\nThe Taliban face many tests — of governance, averting economic collapse and containing terrorist groups.\nThe international community has also insisted on the establishment of an inclusive government. Whether or not the government formed by the Taliban will be deemed ‘inclusive’ enough, international engagement with the Taliban is expected to continue. That will be important to encourage the Taliban to run the country by reaching out to other groups and accommodating others.\nThe most urgent challenge confronting the Taliban is to prevent state collapse that can be triggered by the dire economic situation. Money has to be found to pay the salaries of government personnel, who haven’t been paid for months and to run basic public services. The financial crunch has been compounded by the freezing of funds by Washington, as most of Afghanistan’s foreign reserves lie abroad including in US banks. The IMF and World Bank are said to have withheld assistance and paused projects at Washington’s behest. Doubts have also been voiced over American funding for UN agencies engaged in humanitarian and development work.\nAll of this places great pressure on a new government that has to deal with a war-ravaged country, rising prices, shortage of cash available to citizens and the risk of the economic crunch exacerbating a growing humanitarian crisis. UN Secretary General António Guterres has already warned of an impending “humanitarian catastrophe” with half the population needing assistance. The UN is set to convene a humanitarian conference on Sept 13 to raise much-needed funds.\nThe US is evidently using economic tools to pressure the Taliban to meet both their short-term (safe passage for its nationals and partners) and longer-term demands (no terrorist sanctuary) and to abide by their international obligations. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan recently said the Taliban should cooperate in view of American influence over Afghanistan’s “relationship with the international financial system, its access to any kind of reserves and resources”. In his end-of-mission speech President Joe Biden also referred to Washington’s leverage in this regard without however elaborating.\nThe Taliban are keen on getting international recognition and legitimacy, signalling this repeatedly in their statements. They know access to funds and future assistance is contingent on recognition, which in turn depends on implementing their promises including respect for human rights. So long as the international community stays united and sends a common message to the Taliban there are reasonable chances that they will comply with most commitments. It is one thing to test the Taliban’s intentions by collective pressure but if Western countries, make excessive demands — so-called benchmarks — or use blunt instruments of economic coercion it will prove counterproductive. It could even have the unintended consequence of contributing over time to economic, even state collapse. Humanitarian assistance in any case should not be made conditional.\nThere is international consensus today on core ‘asks’ of the Taliban on counterterrorism and human and women’s rights. But the consensus could fray. An early indication of this came in last month’s meeting of the UN Security Council when a draft resolution on Afghanistan was hastily pushed through by Western members. This prompted Russia and China to abstain. The resolution was adopted but laid bare differences in approach among the P5. In his statement explaining why he abstained the Russian envoy said the resolution failed to name IS-K and ETIM, ignored the “negative impact” of evacuating Afghan nationals in contributing to a brain drain and failed to mention the adverse effects of freezing Afghan financial assets. The Chinese ambassador also objected to the haste in moving the resolution and criticised the assets freeze. And he urged engagement with the Taliban.\nWith another meeting coming up of the Security Council on Sept 27 to renew the mandate of UNAMA (UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan), it is important for its members to maintain a common approach. Renewal of travel exemptions given to several Taliban leaders from UN sanctions will also be considered this month by the relevant Security Council committee.\nAfghanistan’s precarious economic and humanitarian situation is a compelling reason for the international community to constructively engage with Kabul because the alternative can yield an outcome that will not serve regional or international peace and stability. Above all, it would compound the plight of the Afghan people who have already suffered so much."}]}

Almost half its members served in the Taliban’s government in 1996-2001.\nTaliban spokesmen described it as a ‘caretaker’ arrangement that kept open the door to later expansion by accommodating others. There is however little to suggest they will do this. It is at the start of their rule that the Taliban needed to demonstrate to their people and the world that they were willing to depart from the past. If they had included non-Taliban members from minorities and women, they may have been able to change the international conversation and perception of them.\nEditorial:The Taliban’s promises of inclusivity appear to be ringing hollow\nBut the opportunity was squandered. Flushed with victory Taliban leaders seemed to have followed their instincts rather than exercise prudence. They may also have mistaken engagement for acceptance by the international community. Engagement on practical issues is not endearment. The global community’s engagement is for now focused on immediate considerations — evacuating nationals and partners from Kabul by Western countries and providing assistance to avert a humanitarian crisis.\nThe international reaction to the new government has been circumspect including from Pakistan. Western countries have in fact responded sceptically with officials pointing out that this was not the promised ‘inclusive government’. US Secretary of State Antony Blinkenexpressed concernabout “the affiliations and track records of some of the individuals” in the government — a reference to those on the UN sanctions list or who have a US terrorist designation. This indicated that Western states will likely withhold recognition or legitimacy until the Taliban deliver on their promises, especially to ensure that Afghanistan’s soil is not used against any country by terrorist groups that reside there.\nTo win international support the Taliban must show flexibility and deliver on promises.\nWhether the Taliban made a miscalculation about how the world would react to their government or simply didn’t care, their leaders also seem to underestimate the pushback that can emerge against their actions at home. Early signs of this were scattered protests that erupted in several places by hundreds of, mostly, women demanding their rights. The harsh manner in which these peaceful demonstrators were dealt with andintimidation of journalists, hardly burnished the new government’s credentials. It also attracted criticism from the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights whose spokeswoman called on the Taliban to cease the use of force against peaceful protesters.\nInseizing control of Panjshirthe Taliban may have succeeded in eliminating armed resistance but that does not rule out public resistance down the road. After all this is not Afghanistan of the 1990s. Adept at fighting, the Taliban confront governance challenges fundamentally different from when they were last in power. They also have to learn to accommodate the needs and aspirations of a new, better educated generation including women, or face rising discontent. It would be a mistake for them to think that the popular sentiment against foreign occupation and wariness with more conflict is the same as support for them.\nMoreover, the fraught economic situation can spawn public discontent even unrest over time. With its foreign exchange reserves frozen by the US, assistance from the IMF/World Bank suspended and people facing food and cash shortages as well as rising prices the danger looms of a serious economic crisis. That should be reason enough to urge the Taliban government to show flexibility and be responsive to international expectations to secure the flow of funds to avert an economic collapse.\nThe international community has a shared interest in Afghanistan’s stability and is offering assistance to address the humanitarian crisis. In his quarterly report to the UN Security Council of Sept 2 Secretary General António Guterres warned that along with internal displacement “the combination of natural disasters, severe drought, flooding and the third wave of the pandemic have put nearly half of the population of Afghanistan in dire need of humanitarian assistance”. The international aid conference called by him on Sept 13 aims to elicit financial pledges for urgent humanitarian relief.\nBut beyond humanitarian help the international community remains apprehensive about the country’s future. As Guterres put it there is “deep disquiet about what lies ahead”. In meetings of regional states, recently chaired by Pakistan, and the virtual meeting of 22 states, including the EU and Nato, chaired by Secretary Blinken on Sept 8, the common concern was for Afghanistan’s stability and the need for the Taliban to abide by their commitments to counter terrorism and respect human rights.\nThe Sept 9 debate in the Security Council on Afghanistan also reflected the international mood and the terms of engagement spelt out by key members. While pointing out that the US remained the single largest donor of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan the American envoy said “any legitimacy and support will have to be earned” by the Taliban, adding that “the standards the international community has set are clear”. In similar vein the UK representative said her country’s approach will be shaped by what the Taliban do. The Chinese ambassador while urging constructive engagement urged the Taliban to “learn lessons from history, honour its commitments, unite all ethnic groups, build a broad-based and inclusive political architecture, pursue moderate and prudent domestic and foreign policies, protect the rights of women and resolutely combat terrorist groups”. The Russian envoy pointed to “the risk of militants infiltrating the region” and reiterated that Russia’s interest was in Afghanistan’s stabilisation.\nMajor powers and regional states all want to see a stable Afghanistan. By staying united and avoiding divergent approaches the international community can play a positive role in helping to influence Afghanistan’s future. But for the Taliban to win external support and stave off an economic and humanitarian crisis their leaders must also deliver on their pledges, exercise moderation and above all acknowledge that Afghanistan today cannot be governed the way it was under their previous rule."}]}

Perhaps the ruling party’s growing confidence as it embarked on its fourth year in office drove it towards missteps that provoked an expected backlash to its plans. On both the intention to introduce sweeping new media regulations and its ministers’ unseemlyattackon the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) the government’s efforts to get its own way mired it in intense controversy.\nThe front that has already exacted a political cost is the collision with the country’s media. The government seems to be backing down now and has agreed to set up a joint committee with media representatives to review regulations. But the damage to its credibility will not easily be undone. In ameetingwith the information minister, representatives of media bodies left him in no doubt that the proposed Pakistan Media Development Authority (PMDA) was “unacceptable”. Meanwhile PFUJannounceda countrywide ‘long march’ in protest and declared that such a regulatory body was non-negotiable.\nPakistan’s history testifies that no civilian government has won a battle with the media when it united to resist pressure. The last military government too paid a heavy price for taking on the press as this contributed to its ultimate unravelling. Most governments in the recent past used divide-and-rule tactics to manipulate the print and broadcast media — efforts that were always transient and never paid off in the long run. The time-worn tactic of patronising some while penalising the more critical has continued under the present government. Theincarcerationfor almost nine months of Mir Shakil ur Rahman, owner of Pakistan’s largest media group is the most significant case in point.\nThe arbitrary and far-reaching nature of the government’s proposal for a PMDA united the entire media in opposition. Journalists and owners alike saw their fundamental interests under threat. All media representatives and professional associations denounced the move as a “draconian” and “unconstitutional” effort to impose a regime that would be intrusive, coercive, punitive and beyond judicial oversight. In a joint statement a coalition of the country’s press and broadcasters’ bodies rejected the proposed PMDA and cast it as an attempt to stifle the freedom of expression. The curious justification offered for the move by the concerned minister was that it aimed to end ‘fake news’. As if merging different laws that govern the media, film industry and digital platforms and setting up a single government authority has anything to do with that objective. Journalists pointed out there are already cybercrime laws which can be more effectively implemented, and libel laws that can also be strengthened to deal with this.\nThe independence of both the media and ECP is fundamental to democracy.\nThe media’s pushback against this move received wide support, from lawyers’ bodies, civil society, human rights organisations and virtually all opposition parties. At asit-in protestby journalists outside parliament the day of the presidential address to its joint session, top opposition leaders showed up in solidarity and pledged to reject any law if the government went ahead. The irony was not lost that the issue of media freedom united an otherwise fractious opposition engaged in bitter verbal duels with one other.\nThe PMDA proposal was not a random move. It followed official efforts in recent years to control the more independent sections of the media and silence critical voices. This reflects the mindset of many in the ruling party who have long exhibited an intolerance of criticism and proclivity to equate opposition to their policies with lack of patriotism. Critics are seen as enemies to be demonised and not engaged. Going it alone on key policy fronts without consulting stakeholders has been a familiar aspect of PTI’s governance. This is what happened in the case of the PMDA when no media stakeholder was consulted.\nThe government’s unwillingness to accept a view other than its own is also evident in its ministers’ verypublic spatwith the ECP, a constitutional body. Smarting from its electoral setback in Daska earlier this year when the ECP came under fire by ministers for not conducting that by-election ‘fairly’ the government continued to direct criticism at the electoral body. The latest and most egregious attack on the chief election commissioner (CEC) came in the wake of the ECP expressing its inability to accept the government’s proposal to institute electronic voting for the next election. The ECP cited a slew of cogent reasons —37 objections— for its position, which included capacity issues, shortage of time and funding and above all the apprehension that it could be manipulated.\nRead:One step forward, two back\nDuring last week’s meeting of the Senate Standing Committee for Parliamentary Affairs, PTI vice president and railways minister Azam Swati lashed out at the ECP accusing it of “taking bribes” and ballot fraud. He also accused it of working hand in glove with the opposition. Worse, he said such institutions should be “set on fire”. Instead of being reprimanded for these inflammatory remarks by the party high command Swati was later joined by the minister of information, Fawad Choudhry, who made similar allegations at a press conference. Subsequently other PTI spokesmen accused the CEC of partisanship even though he was appointed under their own government by a constitutionally mandated procedure.\nThe ECP’s response was predictable — to issue notices to the two ministers asking them to furnish proof of their allegations. Indications are that the government’s feud with the ECP is unlikely to end anytime soon. The aim seems to be to force an independent-minded CEC from office. Whichever way this confrontation plays out it exposes an attitude on the part of the ruling party that insists on getting its own way and is averse to accepting independent views.\nAlthough the battle with the media and ECP have different implications what is common to both is the government’s evident desire to have pliant institutions. Even though Prime Minister Imran Khan has often extolled the value of a free press, his government now seeks a docile media that acts as its cheerleader rather than does its fundamental job of subjecting government actions to critical scrutiny. But the media cannot be a handmaiden of the government any more than the ECP can be an arm of the executive to blindly do its bidding. The independence of both is critical to democracy."}]}

Already well established is their preoccupation with berating the opposition by using rhetoric more commonly heard during election campaigns. There is also a recurring tendency to cry conspiracy and resort to a victim narrative when faced with a setback.\nMinisters and official spokesmen increasingly adopt a complaining tone and go on prolonged rants about the problem of the day. Consider the response by senior government figures to New Zealand’scancellationof its cricket tour of Pakistan. Public disappointment and anger with this decision was perfectly understandable. As was questioning the grounds on which the decision was made. But it hardly warranted the verbal overdrive ministers went into.\nFirst there were contradictory statements by the information minister. In his initial knee-jerk reaction, hedeclaredthat both New Zealand and England abandoned their tours because the prime minister had said “absolutely not” — referring to his refusal of the US request for bases, despite both countries having said this request was never made. He also claimed an “international lobby” was working against Pakistan. The next day, addressing another press conference with the interior minister, heexplainedhow a fake email emanating from India conjured up a security threat to the New Zealand team and led to its decision not to play. To have issued contrary statements earlier detracted from this significant finding.\nOfficial reaction to the cancellation should really have been in the form of a sober and measured statement — rather than long press conferences — to convey how Pakistan viewed the cancellation, what it had determined lay behind it and what the government planned to do in response. Such a statement would have carried weight shorn of the verbiage and drama of the pressers. Dramas usually undercut the seriousness of a message. Conflicting official explanations further undermined this. The chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, Ramiz Raja, said one thing while ministers claimed another. The PCB chief launched a tirade against what he called the ‘Western bloc’, accusing it of seeking to isolate Pakistan. In avideo messagehe castigated this ‘bloc’ and said he felt “used and binned”. He also donned the mantle of victimhood.\nNarratives of victimhood are self-denigrating and disempowering and also undermine national confidence.\nThis was only the latest episode in which a negative development was over-dramatised by senior ministers and officials as if it was make or break for the country. The proclivity to do this has frequently been on display. Often an adverse comment by some insignificant Western commentator, obscure ex-MP or editorial in a foreign publication is accorded such disproportionate attention as if it poses some kind of existential threat. What has also become an official habit is to explain a situation or an event as a ‘conspiracy’ against the country. This resort to conspiracy theories frees government officials from responsibility and from having to do anything to remedy the problem at hand.\nThe narrative of victimhood is frequently deployed by senior ministers on a diverse set of issues which include the country’s economic difficulties, relations with key countries and dealings with international financial institutions. Significantly though, Prime Minister Imran Khan has rarely if ever engaged in this. Despite that it figures regularly in his government’s foreign policy assertions. Rather than articulate Pakistan’s policy and explain policy actions, top officials often bemoan how unfairly Pakistan is treated in media interviews — as if saying that will influence the world or put the country in question on the defensive. This is often accompanied by an inordinate focus on the past, and a recount of the history of being wronged.\nThis has made whining second nature to those charged with enunciating Pakistan’s foreign policy. Far from invoking sympathy this narrative is tiresome for others and does nothing to advance Pakistan’s case in the international arena. What it does is to expose the country’s vulnerabilities especially to its detractors. A whining tone only reflects helplessness and frustration. It also conveys the impression of being stuck in the past and being bereft of anything substantive to say.\nRead:Politics of intolerance\nConstantly referring to international conspiracies builds an image of the country as having a siege mentality and does little to address the situation being attributed to the conspiracy. It also trivialises the real threats Pakistan faces and shifts the focus away from them. Sinister moves by the country’s adversaries are a reality but they have to be evaluated and responded to with seriousness away from the glare of publicity. Talking about them won’t make them go away. Moreover, press conferences at home get virtually no media play abroad which amounts to having these conversations with ourselves.\nAs for the victim narrative this is self-denigrating and also disempowering. It does nothing for national self-confidence and instead corrodes self-esteem and holds up the country as a weak and powerless target of malign actions by outsiders. If everything is someone else’s fault it also takes away the incentive to solve our own problems and take steps towards the country’s renewal. It is seen both at home and abroad as a substitute for policy actions.\nIt can be argued that conspiracy beliefs and victimhood, which go together, are deeply embedded in societal attitudes for reasons too complex to discuss here, which include social and political factors, an atmosphere of uncertainty and historical experience. That accounts for the general public’s readiness to believe conspiracy theories. The social media also fuels and amplifies these. From that perspective political leaders in and out of government only play off that reality. But in so doing they further reinforce such attitudes and encourage paranoia and a victim mentality. And on issues where they know better, they mislead people by invoking conspiracy as an expedient diversion from owning up to their own responsibility. In any case leadership is about guiding and shaping public attitudes not leveraging societal prejudices and irrational viewpoints for political advantage. Stagecraft can’t be a substitute for statecraft. Responsible statecraft requires responsible leadership."}]}

In his first foreign policy speech since the American withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden declared that US military power would now be an option of last and not first resort. He called for international cooperation to meet common challenges and pledged to work with allies. He also said the US was “not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs.”\nWelcome assertions that contrasted sharply with the blustering rhetoric of President Donald Trump. But the Biden administration’s actions have been at odds with many of these words. Both policy towards China and Washington’s treatment of allies have not been consistent with these pronouncements. Consider what happened on the heels of the US departure from Afghanistan. As if to swiftly make good on the promise to pivot to bigger challenges — ie China — Washington forged a newtrilateral security pactwith the UK and Australia named AUKUS. The coalition’s aim is to counter Chinese power in the Asia Pacific region by assisting Australia to build eight nuclear-powered submarines equipped with Tomahawk missiles.\nThis effort at enhancing Australia’s naval power to challenge China’s military ascendancy in the western Pacific met a sharp response from Beijing. Accusing AUKUS nations of an “outdated zero-sum Cold War mentality”, Beijing denounced the move as “irresponsible” and said it would “undermine regional peace and security and intensify the arms race”. To be sure this deal is consequential for the international non-proliferation regime. As former IAEA official Tariq Rauf recently wrote, “it could well open up a Pandora’s box of proliferation with non-nuclear-weapon states also going in for nuclear-powered submarines and keeping nuclear fuel outside the scope of IAEA safeguards”.\nThe world’s most consequential relationship is drifting into uncharted waters in a fraught environment.\nThe immediate diplomatic fallout from the deal was a rift among America’s allies. Paris, which was not kept in the loop and saw Australia abandon its plan to acquire diesel-electric French submarines,reacted furiously. France’s foreign minister described it as a “stab in the back”. While Washington sought to calm French anger in a phone call from Biden to President Emmanuel Macron, the damage to relations was already done. The signal sent to Europe was that the US could act as it wished without taking allies on board. It laid bare the gap between Biden’s pledge to consult partners and his policy steps. Building a coalition against China by AUKUS opened up cracks in the transatlantic alliance which Biden had earlier sought to shore up for his anti-Beijing diplomatic strategy. The security pact also made many Asean countries nervous — their economies being closely integrated with China’s global supply chain.\nRead:The politics of AUKUS\nIn the week following the AUKUS announcement Bidenhosted a summitof Quad leaders — US, Australia, Japan and India — in another effort to fortify an anti-China front among regional states. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue was resuscitated by the Trump administration in 2017 with the aim of countering China. But, as many Western analysts pointed out, Quad has now been undercut by AUKUS. US officials described it as non-military and “informal”. The haste with which Washington acted after its Afghan withdrawal — perhaps to shift attention away from that debacle — involved moves that appeared so haphazard as to leave many allies disconcerted. For example, a former Indian foreign secretary Nirupuma Rao said there was “a strategic ambush of Quad by AUKUS” and questioned its rationale when Quad already existed.\nThe statement issued after the Quad summit committed member countries to a “free and open Indo-Pacific”. While it never mentioned China, the meeting — and indeed Quad itself — is focused principally on offsetting China’s rising power. The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman responded to the Quad summit by cautioning the US not to engage in “closed and exclusive small circles” whileGlobal Times— which reflects Beijing’s views — depicted it as an attempt to “incite disputes and confrontation in the western Pacific”. What both the AUKUS and Quad moves have done is to intensify US-China tensions and confirmed to Beijing that a US-led contain-China strategy continues to unfold.\nBut while the Biden administration is stepping up anti-China efforts on the global front, at home its domestic agenda has been mired in the country’s intensely polarised environment. The irony is that while much energy is being expended abroad Biden’s grip on his own party is being tested by two key pieces of domestic legislation, an infrastructure bill and the social safety spending package, on which Democratic party liberals have strong reservations. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans who had blocked a debt limit bill came around to support stopgap legislation offered as a last-minute compromise by the ruling party. This averted a government shutdown and debt default but will keep government funding going only till December. It therefore kicks the can down the road with more bruising Congressional battles ahead.\nPerhaps because of these domestic troubles Biden is adopting a more aggressive stance towards Beijing than expected as it is on the international front that he has greater room to manoeuvre. But he is also reflecting political consensus in the US for a tougher posture towards Beijing. For their part, Chinese officials see little to distinguish between Trump and Biden’s policies on China. On trade their approach is identical as Trump-era tariffs remain intact. Chinese leaders have repeatedly warned the US against engaging in a Cold War and see the Biden administration pursuing a strategy of ‘confrontational competition’. In September when President Biden had hisfirst phone conversationwith President Xi Jinping in seven months the Chinese leader is reported to have declined Biden’s suggestion for a summit meeting, insisting that the US first dial down its belligerent rhetoric and improve the atmosphere for such engagement.\nRead:UN chief warns China, US to avoid Cold War\nChina’s interest nonetheless lies in steadying rocky relations as it has much to lose from prolonged confrontation. But in the face of a tough US posture, it has little option but to push back which it is doing ever more vigorously. All this indicates more turbulence ahead for the world’s most consequential relationship as it drifts into uncharted waters in a geostrategic environment that is already so unsettled."}]}

The former US president acted not just irresponsibly and unpredictably but was intensely divisive both for his country and the world. His brand of populism was infused by xenophobic and racist views with his ‘America First’ slogan shaping his unilateralist foreign policy. At home he mainstreamed and emboldened the far right, fringe extremist groups and white supremacists who have become an enduring part of the American political landscape.\nThe world watched in horror when Trump refused to accept the results of the November 2020 presidential election, declined to cooperate in the transfer of power and incited a violent mob to storm Congress to prevent it from certifying the election result. This was followed by his historic impeachment on the charge of “incitement of insurrection”, becoming the only president to be impeached twice. Bob Woodward’s new book,Peril, co-authored with Robert Costa, chronicles these dramatic events and much more. It is the third in his trilogy, the first two beingFearandRageabout Trump’s turbulent time in office.\nRead:US general doubted Trump’s sanity, called China to calm nerves: book\nWoodward writes the ultimate ‘insider’ accounts about American presidents, politics and foreign policy. His 2010 bookObama’s Warhas lost little of its relevance, and is worth revisiting after America’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. It shines a light on the internal ‘wars’, policy rifts and personality clashes in the Obama administration over the course to follow in America’s longest war. The policy muddle and strategic flaws in Washington’s approach to Afghanistan are persuasively recounted based on authoritative sources.\nHis new book is just as compelling. The most sensational disclosure for which it received much pre-publication publicity is how the senior-most US military officer assured his Chinese counterpart that America wasn’t about to attack his country given the alarm both in China and elsewhere that an increasingly unhinged Trump might “go rogue” and order a military strike. This episode forms the book’s prologue. Another chapter describes this in more detail as also Gen Mark Milley’s conversation with Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, during which she sought assurances that Trump would be prevented from any reckless course including resort to nuclear weapons.\nA compelling new book chronicles the dramatic events that almost pushed America over the edge.\nThese disclosures triggered intense controversy which echoed in recentCongressional hearingson Afghanistan when Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, was asked if they were true. He acknowledged he made two calls to Gen Li Zoucheng of PLA, one before and another after the election, because the Chinese were worried about a US attack. But he said this with the knowledge of top Trump officials and also because he was mandated to ensure “strategic stability”. As for the conversation with Pelosi he told lawmakers he had “sought to assure her that nuclear launch is governed by a very specific and deliberate process”. He also acknowledged he had been interviewed by Woodward. In fact, the book seems to rely heavily on Milley’s accounts of events. He was among more than 200 people interviewed by the authors.\nThe book’s short chapters go back and forth between Trump’s erratic conduct and Biden mulling over whether to run for the White House a third time and how he wanted his family to make that call given the many tragedies it had faced. Several chapters offer vignettes of both men in the eventful days leading up to the election and insights into how they ran their campaigns. Trump’s attempts and failure to challenge and delegitimise the election is also dealt with in great detail. The role of US military chiefs looms large in the treatment of Trump’s reaction to the protests against racism that erupted after the death of George Floyd in police custody. They resisted and foiled his attempt to deploy troops on the streets and deal with demonstrations by invoking the Insurrection Act.\nThe Jan 6violent assaulton the US Capitol is described by an almost minute by minute account. Days after the attack, Milley, says the book, noted in his daily dairy: “Big Threat: Domestic terrorism.” He identified the attackers as far right militias, extreme Tea Party and new Brown Shirts, a US version of the paramilitary wing of the Nazi party. And he concluded it was a planned revolution. In fact, US security agencies had been warning earlier — this is not mentioned in the book — that armed white supremist groups had emerged among the most lethal threats to the country. In Congressional testimony in October 2019, the FBI director had revealed that “racially motivated violent extremism”, principally from white supremacists, represented “the majority of domestic terrorism threats”. It is these groups that Trump encouraged.\nReaders in Pakistan will be most interested in Chapter 60 which deals with Biden’s review of Afghan policy. This goes over familiar ground of how as vice president he opposed Obama’s troop surge. Now as president he wanted to hear a range of views on this although everyone knew he wanted since 2009 to end US involvement in Afghanistan. In two months, there were 25 National Security Council meetings among others in one of “the most wide-ranged policy reviews ever held”.\nBiden was “determined not to be jammed” by the military as Obama had been. This chapter has him asking a series of key questions — had the US not long gone beyond its original aim to defeat Al Qaeda? Was the nature of threat such as to require keeping thousands of troops there? The answer came in his decision to completely pull out and end America’s ‘forever’ war. The book claims that the Pentagon and Nato ministers argued for a slower “gated” withdrawal to provide leverage for diplomatic efforts for a political settlement. But when Secretary of State Antony Blinken proposed a delayed pullout to the Taliban in Doha they rejected it and warned that if this happened, they would attack US forces and provincial capitals. Biden then stuck to his decision and “seemed at peace” with it. And the rest, as they say, is history."}]}

But the ability to address them is being jeopardised by several factors — lack of national unity, intensely polarised politics, institutional disharmony, and absence of political will to undertake long postponed, fundamental economic reforms.\nSharply polarised politics have become a familiar aspect of the country’s political landscape. Withgovernment-opposition tensionsshowing no sign of abating, a non-consensual democracy is in operation. Unilateral, go-it-alone governance seems to be even more pronounced now. The latest example is the PTI government’s plan via a presidential ordinance toextend the termof the NAB chairman despite the opposition’s vociferous objections. It is also exemplified by the government’sinsistenceon instituting electronic voting for the next election, without any agreement with opposition parties or the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). This adds up to a deeply divided polity that can hardly generate the consensus needed to address national challenges.\nInstitutional disharmony has most dramatically and consequentially been evidenced in the posting of the head of Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency and appointment of his successor. Theprolonged impassebetween Prime Minister Imran Khan and the army leadership on such a sensitive matter may have echoes from similar unedifying experiences in the past. But it indicated that the ‘same page’ narrative was wearing thin and that civil-military relations were unlikely to be the same again. The public manner in which the government played this issue only added to the strains in the relationship. This has bred uncertainty at a time when energy needs to be directed to deal with the country’s multiple challenges.\nEditorial:Much vaunted civil-military ‘one page’ appears increasingly frayed\nInstitutional disharmony and polarised politics are impeding efforts to address the country’s challenges.\nThe government’sconfrontational stancetowards the ECP is another example of lack of institutional harmony between the executive and a constitutional body, mandated to act independently. Rather than engage the ECP to address its objections to electronic voting, ministers have been vilifying the Commission and accusing it of partisanship. This underlines the PTI leadership’s proclivity to bulldoze its way in displays of intolerance.\nIntroduction of theSingle National Curriculumalso illustrates the government moving on its own rather than first building a wide consensus among stakeholders and eliciting a buy-in for the move. The initiative is widely seen by educationists as a leap backwards rather than a step in the direction of modernising the education sector to bring it into sync with 21st-century requirements.\nAll this at a time when the country confronts formidable challenges at home and abroad. The biggest challenge is a fragile economy faced with an internal and external cash liquidity crunch, growing resource constraints, spiralling debt, rising inflation, runaway food prices, falling rupee and sluggish growth and investment. Beyond the unresolved problems of a rentier economy rooted in chronic budget and balance-of-payments deficits there are warning signs of danger ahead that can snowball into a crisis.\nRead:Where is the economy headed?\nFirst and foremost, delay in forging agreement with the IMF is already exacting a toll — depleting foreign exchange reserves, pressure on the rupee and eroding business confidence. If the Fund programme is delayed beyond December certain consequences will flow — significant financial outflow, fall in reserves, inability to service debt and an external financing crisis. The rollover of debt payments to key creditor countries is also predicated on a Fund programme.\nAnother warning signal is rising debt, both internal and external. Public debt is now 91 per cent of GDP (it was 79pc in 2018). Power sector debt has risen exponentially while the circular debt problem has been compounded with no indication of any meaningful resolution. Inability to deal with power sector arrears risks cuts in power supply in winter when demand for gas rises. A third danger sign and the most politically consequential is rising inflation. This is due to a combination of reasons including supply-side and monetary factors while unbridled subsidy schemes have also contributed to it. Food inflation is even higher which is already generating much public disquiet. Unless the government comes to grips with these clear and present dangers the economy risks being blown off course.\nForeign policy challenges are no less imposing with Afghanistan posing the most proximate challenge. Uncertainty continues over whether the Taliban will be able to govern and meet key expectations of the international community essential to avert an economic collapse. In this fluid environment the government has adopted an ill-thought narrative, acting as a virtual spokesperson for the Taliban. It is one thing to help a neighbour, extend humanitarian assistance and call for international engagement. This makes eminent sense. But it is quite another to offer assurances on the Taliban’s behalf when they have yet to deliver on international obligations. It also does not behove officials to publicly make apocalyptic predictions of what might happen in Afghanistan if the international community doesn’t engage. Our policy should distinguish between Pakistan’s interests and the Taliban’s which are far from identical.\nOther external challenges also have to be met. Despite the government’s repeated claims to have conducted an effective foreign policy the record shows otherwise. Key areas and the state of Pakistan’s priority relationships offer little reason for self-congratulation. The government has yet to build diplomatic support on Kashmir, relations with the US remain in a state of disrepair and China’s concerns over tardy implementation of CPEC projects have still to be adequately addressed. Lack of sustained and institutionalised engagement with Saudi Arabia, has meant a lost opportunity — the ambitious Saudi investment plan unveiled two years ago has not been realised.\nDaily press releases and non-stop press conferences or tweets do not obscure the fact that diplomatic gains have been elusive. Megaphone diplomacy aimed only at the home audience does nothing for the country. Ministers go on and on about how the government has effectively presented Kashmir’s case to the world. But they fail to show what tangible outcome has been achieved from this. The test of foreign policy is to secure outcomes that advance the country’s interests and not the number of speeches that are delivered.\nThe country’s domestic and foreign policy challenges need prudent decisions and purposeful actions. What seems to stand in their way is a lack of focus on governance, tensions between key institutions and a deeply polarised polity."}]}

The diplomatic impasse between the two countries continues with formal dialogue long suspended and toughly worded statements exchanged every so often. The latest was Islamabad’scondemnationlast week of a provocative pronouncement by India’s home minister who threatened “surgical strikes” against Pakistan. In response the foreign ministry accused Delhi of “stoking regional tensions”.\nNevertheless,backchannel communicationat the intelligence level continues. This was set in motion over two years ago. But it has made no progress towards resuming the broad-based peace process. The start-stop process was known at various points as ‘Composite Dialogue’, ‘Resumed Dialogue’ and ‘Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue’. It was abandoned by India many years ago. No agreement has been reached on the backchannel to restore normal diplomatic representation after it was downgraded and trade halted by Pakistan. This followed Delhi’s illegal annexation of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019.\nThe backchannel contact did however lead to the February 2021re-commitmentby Pakistan and India to observe a ceasefire on the Line of Control in line with a 2003 understanding. From the dangerous confrontation epitomised by the Balakot crisis two years ago, the two countries stepped back from the brink and agreed to the LoC truce. The ceasefire has since held. But expectations that this thaw would pave the way for normalisation of ties have not been realised. Despite apparent assurances on the backchannel by the Indian side to ease the situation in Kashmir, restore its ‘statehood’ and dial down its aggressive rhetoric none of this happened. Backchannel communication may have played a role in managing tensions but its limits have been laid bare by lack of movement on substantive issues.\nThere has recently been working-level diplomatic engagement on practical issues such as civilian prisoners, issuance of visas to officials and fishermen detained for maritime trespassing. These discussions may well yield agreement on such issues in the coming days. But this does not presage movement towards a dialogue on substantive issues or disputes that have long divided the two countries — the most outstanding of course being Kashmir.\nRead:The road to peace with India will take much more than the desire for better relations\nManagement of Pakistan-India tensions is likely to remain the main focus of sporadic backchannel efforts.\nPakistan has repeatedly declared that dialogue can only resume if India rescinds its Aug 5, 2019, actions. Meanwhile, India’s repression in Kashmir shows no sign of easing with continuing grave violations of human rights. The situation remains dire with sweeping restrictions, a military siege and suspension of fundamental freedoms. Since the so-called integration of the state into the Indian union and abrogation of Article 370 of its constitution the government of Narendra Modi has pursued a policy to bring aboutdemographic changes, in utter violation of UN Security Council resolutions, and to delimit electoral constituencies. Both aim to reduce the Muslim majority by shifting the balance to Hindus. These actions have drawn strong protests from Islamabad and been roundly rejected by the people of occupied Kashmir. The deepening alienation and growing anger of the Kashmiri people underlines Delhi’s failure to secure their acquiescence by the use of force, fraud and economic inducements.\nModi’s efforts to enlist support for his Kashmir strategy from traditionally pro-India Kashmiri politicians have also ended in failure. In June 2021, he invited these leaders to a round table conference on Kashmir. The genuine representatives of the Kashmiri people, who form the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, were excluded. They denounced this meeting as nothing more than a drama. Meanwhile, APHC leaders continue to languish in jail or house detention.\nThe aim of Modi’s move was to consolidate the August 2019 action by seeking to establish a facade of ‘normality’ and enticing select politicians to re-join a revived political process. By showing its intent to initiate a political process in Kashmir the Modi government has tried to persuade people at home and abroad that the situation is ‘normalising’. It sought agreement for the delimitation plan to pave the way for so-called elections in Kashmir, which in turn would aim to ‘endorse’ the 2019 action. But even handpicked Kashmiri leaders did not fall for this bait. Themeetingproduced no outcome and ended in failure.\nIn this backdrop and persisting deadlock the future outlook for Pakistan-India relations is exceedingly uncertain. Immediate prospects are anything but bright. Looking ahead, three possible scenarios can be postulated for the future course of relations. The best-case but unlikeliest scenario is for the peace process to resume, cover all issues including Kashmir and other disputes, as well as trade and terrorism, two issues of priority for India. Serious efforts would be directed to conflict resolution and a result-oriented process set in train that encourages both sides towards compromise to achieve a negotiated settlement of core issues. This scenario is urged by the stark reality that strategic dynamics between the two nuclear neighbours remain fraught and unpredictable. But there is no possibility of the scenario materializing in the near term.\nA second scenario is arguably the most unstable in which an acrimonious stand-off persists and mounting tensions sparked by an incident or action spin out of control. Escalatory steps by one or both parties heighten the risk of a crisis. The nuclear factor prevents an outbreak of conflict but the two countries become locked in deadly confrontation raising the danger of uncontrollable escalation.\nThe third scenario is more of the same. Formal dialogue remains suspended, disputes are left to fester, low-level diplomatic engagement takes place but no headway is made to normalise ties. A backchannel tries to manage tensions and prevent them from boiling over even as a war of words erupts from time to time. This seems the most probable scenario for now. With Delhi ruling out talks on Kashmir and Pakistan unable to agree to a dialogue minus Kashmir it is hard to see how this impasse can be overcome. The prospect then is for Pakistan and India to continue in an uneasy state of no war, no peace with management of tensions being the principal focus of sporadic if quiet diplomacy. But on this count too both countries have yet to put a proper framework in place to manage tensions."}]}

This has also been the case in Pakistan. Many features of the political landscape today reflect the country’s long-standing, overlapping fault lines that keep getting perpetuated. They merit consideration to understand how current government-opposition tensions, parliament’s unedifying performance, the government’s wavering before street pressure from a banned militant group, uneasy civil-military relations and the burden of unresolved structural economic problems are all echoes from Pakistan’s chequered past, that its leaders seem unable to escape.\nFive features are noteworthy. One, the ongoing confrontation between the government and opposition has a long pedigree in the country’s history. A culture of compromise and consensus never took root which left democracy fragile and open to interventions by the military, which could always count on support from motley political parties to oust governments. There were rare moments of political consensus as for example when the 1973 Constitution was adopted and in the more recent past, the unanimous passage of the 18th Amendment in 2010. Beyond these and some other exceptions the tradition has been of intolerance with the ethic of war not competition informing political behaviour.\nEditorial:Opposition eyes unique opportunity amid perceived rupture between PM and establishment\nLack of tolerance has also been evidenced in troubled centre-province relations which repeatedly tested the country’s unity with deleterious consequences. This needs little elaboration but it illustrates how federalism was observed more in its breach than practice. The notion that reciprocal obligations between the centre and provinces are more than a constitutional precept and have to be fulfilled is still not readily accepted. This is apparent fromtesty relationstoday between the PTI government and PPP’s government in Sindh.\nTwo, parliament’s current under performance is also a throwback to the past as successive governments, despite their declared commitment to parliamentary supremacy, never lived up to this principle. The preferred way of legislating has often been by ordinance. Parliament has been seen, as now, principally as a means to maintain the government in power rather than an instrument of governance, a forum to initiate and debate laws and policy. Thus, its evolution as a strong and effective political institution has been undermined by these factors.\nBreaking from the past needs bold and visionary leadership which remains elusive.\nA third enduring fault line is how governments and state institutions have over the years wavered when faced with agitation by religious zealots or extremists. The latest example has been headline news for days now. The government has sent contradictory signals, initially of appeasement, then vacillation, followed by confused declarations of firmness in dealing with a proscribed group protesting in the streets. This treads a well-worn path of dithering or succumbing to such pressure. This goes back to the country’s early years and subsequently to successive governments that sought to meet challenges by conceding to the demands of such groups. Aimed to bring an end to the crisis of the day it emboldened these forces and fanned sentiments articulated by them only for these groups to rear their head again and challenge the state.\nRead more:The irony of the government's response to TLP march\nUneasy civil-military relations recently evidenced in theappointment of the new headof Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency have also been a familiar aspect of the country’s political history and represents a fourth fault line. To some extent unstable relations are inherent where there are two — often competing — centres of political power. Given Pakistan’s history of military interventions, even under democratic rule the military has had a prominent role and cast a long shadow on the country’s politics and governance. This is also reflected in the frequent ouster of civilian governments by the military. The power imbalance and asymmetry between elected and unelected institutions derived from a historical legacy in which security and order had primacy over democracy.\nThe fifth fault line has been the most consequential to Pakistan’s fate and fortunes. This is an oligarchical elite’s reliance on borrowing, bailouts and an overvalued exchange rate to address the country’s chronic financial crises and its resistance to mobilise domestic resources including by taxing itself. The enigma of successive governments living beyond their means can only be explained by a power elite averse to measures it perceived as threatening its political interests. This contributed to miring Pakistan in perpetual financial crises with almost every past government acting in a fiscally irresponsible way and leaving the economy in worse shape for its successor to manage.\nThe failure to raise enough resources along with low levels of savings and investment, meant that successive governments since the 1980s ran huge deficits in national expenditure and on the external account. These twin deficits — budget and balance of payments — were financed by printing more currency notes and by inflow of funds from abroad including remittances from overseas workers. It left the country living from one IMF tranche to another. Moreover, bank borrowing at home served as an immensely regressive measure because it translated into forced transfer of savings to the government from people least able to bear the burden of inflation, the most pernicious tax on the poor. Economic management that relied on borrowing permitted the country’s rulers to avoid and postpone much-needed structural reforms, including tax reform, that could place the economy on a viable, self-reliant path. Instead, this led to an exorbitant rise in debt and landed Pakistan in a classic debt trap.\nThis kind of economic management continues to this day. It means that the structural sources of the country’s chronic financial imbalances remain unaddressed: a narrow and inequitable tax regime, the energy sector’s circular debt, bankrupt public-sector enterprises, a broken public finance management system, heavy regulatory burden and a narrow export base.\nNo account of major fault lines is complete without reference to the role of the country’s foreign engagements in reinforcing some of these fault lines. The use of foreign alignments to gain access to funds to finance consumption reinforced dependence on external largesse and served to avoid domestic reforms. TheSaudi ‘package’announced last week exemplifies this continuing dependency.\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Fault lines don’t have to persist. They can be overcome. And they should as they impede the country’s progress, development and prosperity. But breaking from the past requires a different quality of leadership — bold, wise and visionary — that remains elusive."}]}

Not only has this done little to inspire public confidence in the PTI government, it has also divided opinion in the country and raised afresh questions about the direction it is taking. This also means that while the government rules it does not govern. It wields power but that doesn’t translate into showing the leadership needed to effectively meet the country’s challenges.\nThe most spectacular example of the government’s flawed response to a challenge is provided by the TLP affair. Its approach was mired in confusion from the start as supporters of the banned grouplocked down GT Roadand threatened to march on Islamabad. Characteristically, cabinet ministers gave contradictory statements. The interior minister surpassed his own record of bluster. The government lurched between appeasement and declarations of firmness about upholding the writ of the state. But tough rhetoric by government leaders bore little relation to reality. In the end the state’s writ lay in shambles by the agreement forged with the proscribed group.\nWorse, the government insisted on keeping the terms of theagreementsecret. Never before had a deal struck after violent protests — which left seven policemen dead and scores injured — been shrouded in such secrecy, despite its far-reaching implications. Calls by the opposition and media to make the agreement public were rejected by the government. The terms of capitulation however emerged in subsequent days, laying bare the heavy price paid to settle an admittedly vexed situation — a price that will haunt the country in times to come. That the establishment played a key role only raised questions about the judgement of both the government and its backers. Reports that the government was considering an electoral alliance with TLP in Punjab indicated that the re-empowered militant outfit would be allowed to contest polls. The Punjab government has already taken the first step to end the ban on TLP. This adds another disturbing dimension to an unedifying episode.\nEditorial:The govt has a lot to answer for regarding its deal with the TLP\nThe government’s decision in another area also illustrated its muddled and non-consensual approach to running the country. For the third time in a month, itamendedthe NAB ordinance and, as usual, without taking the opposition or its coalition partners on board. The National Accountability (Amendment) Ordinance was promulgated on Oct 6. Subsequent changes reflected haste and lack of thinking. The substance of the changes was even more worrying. The government did little to address questions raised by excluding some cases from NAB’s purview, maintaining or grandfathering others on money laundering and emphasising those relating to unexplained assets. Not only should these amendments have been taken to parliament for deliberation, their rationale should also have been explained by the government.\nMuddling through and taking unilateral actions only widens the gap between challenge and response.\nThe most significant aspect of the third amendment was that it eroded the formal ‘independence’ of the NAB chairman as it took away the power to remove him from the Supreme Judicial Council and gave it to the executive. Under this the chairman will serve at the will of the prime minister and be obliged to comply with his political dictates. The attorney general went public to advise the government to ‘return’ this power to the Supreme Judicial Council through parliament. His counsel on grounds that the amendment would be legally challenged was rejected by the government. The Supreme Court Bar Association has alreadyannouncedit would mount such a challenge.\nThese piecemeal amendments did not emerge from any process of consultation with the opposition, which in any case was ruled out by promulgating an ordinance in the first place. Predictably, opposition leaders assailed the move and described it as aimed at continuing “political victimisation” of opponents. They also criticised the government for bypassing parliament. This indicates that unilateral changes to an entity already mired in political controversy would be bereft of legitimacy and lack necessary consensus for its credible functioning.\nEditorial:The latest NAB ordinance amendment makes a mockery of an already compromised institution\nMeanwhile on another issue — electoral reform that includes instituting electronic voting machines for the next election — the government announced its intention to call a joint session of parliament this month to adopt legislation on this. That means pressing ahead despite objections on EVMs from both the opposition and the Election Commission of Pakistan. As the government lacks a majority in the Senate, it has sought the route of a joint session in which it can muster the numbers to get the electoral reforms/EVM bill passed by parliament. This again exemplifies its insistence on getting its own way by disregarding the views of others. But it also represents an effort to dilute the Senate’s legislative role and in so doing undermines a fundamental federal principle. Previous governments also resorted to this but that doesn’t make it any more acceptable.\nIf governing without consensus has become a familiar trait of the ruling party other habits it has formed contribute to its distinct way of running the government. Its tendency to blame every problem on something or someone else is daily on display. Virtually all present challenges are blamed on past governments or on factors extraneous to itself. It is of course true that the PTI government inherited a troublesome economic legacy, but so has virtually every government in recent decades. However, three years into office it has to learn to assume responsibility. Governments are expected to fix problems not moan about the past. To explain every economic difficulty by reference to the past doesn’t work anymore. Nor does the present official narrative to justify rising inflation bycomparisonwith other countries, where income and purchasing power are higher than in Pakistan. Also, the government has blamed the Sindh government for the spike in sugar prices when its own mismanagement and failure to import an adequate amount produced an acute shortage and hence the price rise.\nUsing disingenuous arguments to evade responsibility does nothing to reassure the public that the government is doing anything to address their problems. Governance is about owning responsibility and about less talk than action. Muddling through, taking unilateral decisions and not thinking them through only widens the gap between challenge and response and between rule and governance."}]}

The coronavirus pandemic has only added to uncertainty in international politics at a time when the world is in flux — with global power shifting, the stand-off between the world’s two superpowers continuing and a rules-based order eroding as big powers qualify their support to multilateralism.\nHow does one describe this era? The latestStrategic Surveyby the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies, among the best annual reviews of geopolitics, grapples with this question but rejects the idea that a single phrase or typology can capture it. It refers to several descriptions including “return to great power politics”, “A G2 world”, “The Asian century” but finds that none of them work to reflect a multidimensional reality. Diverse issues have strategic impact, it says.\nNevertheless, even without invoking a single overarching phrase to depict present-day geopolitics certain key features of the strategic environment stand out. They include fierce competition between the two global powers, weakening commitment to multilateralism amid growing multipolarity, intensification of tech wars, retreat of globalisation, renewal of regional conflicts, rise of hyper-nationalism as well as of authoritarian, populist leaders.\nRead more:Turning from Afghanistan, US sets focus on China\nThe policy and intellectual debate about the international landscape that has to be negotiated today is enriched by several new books. One of them is the recently publishedWorld Politics Since 1989by the Belgian scholar, Jonathan Holslag. But this no simple rundown of recent global events. It is an intelligent guide to understanding the shifts in international politics and the varied challenges of our times. It deals with key turning points or moments of change in order to encourage deeper thinking about the underlying political, economic and social factors. Holslag sees world politics as a ‘grey zone’, a web of interrelated trends and argues that the internal dynamics of states are just as important in shaping international affairs.\nThe strategic environment is marked by instability and uncertainties of a fractured world.\nThe book starts with the end of the Cold War and the advent of globalisation, which held out a promising era of peace, cooperation and prosperity for all. The author then fast forwards to 2019 when the pendulum swung back as trends of de-globalisation, extreme nationalism, xenophobia and authoritarianism became dominant. That was also when the world saw Brexit and Trump’s narrowdefeat in the US election. Interstate tensions and territorial conflicts erupted while the West fragmented and failed to lead. He maintains that the three post-Cold War decades, following a ‘shaky’ unipolar moment, was a missed opportunity and produced a crisis of politics, diplomacy and even civilisation. And when the coronavirus pandemic overwhelmed the world “instead of joining forces the major powers unleashed a propaganda war” and WHO became a battleground between the US and China.\nHolslag seeks answers for the resurgence of nationalism and turbulence and finds them in a combination of factors. He focuses on eight themes in the book. He identifies them as: limits of globalisation due to its unequal impact, fundamental global power shift, changing nature of power, the ‘decadence trap’ (when reckless consumerism in the West triumphed over civic duty and entrepreneurship), Western hubris that produced half-hearted engagement, “remote-control interventions” and bombing countries “into obedience”, the West’s unintended fuelling of authoritarianism, reaction against the West’s coercive. approach that yielded the politics of strife rather than cooperation, and a surfeit of learning undermined by a deficit of actions.\nA thoughtful critique of Western policies runs throughout the book’s 12 chapters but is particularly telling in the one on foreign policy. The author explains that the West’s own goals — “inconsistent policies” — were responsible for its weakening and challenges to its leadership. Among these was the failure to learn lessons from successive economic crises. Even after the West’s apparent, though superficial, triumph in the Cold War it demonstrated a reluctance to lead. The rhetoric was of confidence, but in deeds there was reluctance. He shows how the policy contradiction between asserting global leadership and ‘remote-control engagement’ undermined Western goals. Reliance on sanctions to make states compliant produced this: “By the late 1990s over half of the world’s population was subject to coercive economic measures”, mostly imposed by the US. And “the foreign policy discourse was interventionist and moralising”.\nPost-9/11, he writes, Western especially US foreign policy became “a curious combination of a dysfunctional crusade against terrorism and an ineffective campaign to advance globalization”. The recklessness of the unilateralist American approach was evidenced in the two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that overstretched it as well as its partners. Regime change was sought and the consequence of what Holslag calls mission creep, hubris and miscalculation was that it left the US and the West diminished and their global reputation damaged. He also refers here to Pakistan’s military that saw “Washington as arrogant and only interested in saving its face”.\nRead more:Longest war: Were America’s two decades in Afghanistan worth it?\nResentment against the West also intensified, according to the author, by the refusal to reform the international financial architecture despite its eroding economic power. And while the West weakened, China’s rise continued apace. With its rapid growth it also linked much of Asia to its economy and supply chain. Holslag’s analysis of the Chinese economic miracle is both insightful and instructive. But his discussion of why the world got to where it is today is even more compelling. He argues that after the 2008 financial crisis, stability never revived in the West which lost its position as the global economic centre. Political trust in governments plunged. Democracy weakened. All of this contributed to the fragility of peace in the world.\nRead more:The Chinese economic miracle\nHolslag sees three changes that have defined the world order, the rise of China, decline of optimism in the Global South as regional powers like India and Brazil failed to strengthen their economies and what he calls the return of “hard hedging”. By the latter he means regional powers playing to both camps — US and China — to avoid taking sides in order to maximise their options and autonomy. As a result, the world today is “more fragmented and turbulent”. This is a must-read book for students but even more so for policymakers, business leaders and all those interested in what drives geopolitics today."}]}

The PTI government’s insistence on pushing through an amendment to the Elections Act 2017 to provide for electronic voting machines (EVMs), in disregard of objections from the combined opposition and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) predictably produced chaotic scenes in parliament. The opposition too brought little credit to itself by its conduct. It had every right to reject the amendment, but tearing up agenda papers, shouting down the Speaker and staging a walkout was unnecessary.\nThe treasury benches got their way by bulldozing the electoral reforms bill. But it marks a pyrrhic victory. When a significant membership of parliament opposed the move, the amendment lacks both consensus and legitimacy. As its practicality is also in doubt its implementation in the near term is open to question.\nRead more:The PTI has legislated mayhem by choice\nThe government has long wanted parliamentary approval for EVMs. Having secured this, formidable hurdles lie ahead. The ECP has alreadypointed to challengesin instituting this for the next election, now less than two years away. There are issues of capacity, acquiring a yet to be determined number of machines, training personnel and funding this huge enterprise. Thus, simply pushing through a bill does not mean the ECP can easily execute this. More so as EVMs have not even been tested on a limited scale, for example in by-elections over the last year. This also applies to granting the right to vote by internet to overseas Pakistanis. Arrangements for this too will be complex and again, it will be up to the ECP to determine when and how it will be able to implement this.\nMeanwhile, the Speaker’s role in helping the ruling party force a number of other bills, over 30 of them through the joint session — without debate or deliberation — was not only unprecedented but also damaged the credibility of an office that is obliged to stay neutral. Never before were a record number of bills read out in such a rapid-fire manner and then declared adopted by the Speaker after voice votes. This has gravely undermined parliament’s role.\nThe government faces trouble if it continues in hubristic mode and doesn’t address pressing challenges.\nThe political energy the government expended on this move at a time when there are more consequential challenges that merit urgent attention is baffling. Not only does it speak of official priorities being out of sync with public expectations but it also underlines how out of touch the ruling party seems to be with opinion on the ‘street’. Public opinion is being shaped today by rising economic discontent as inflation bites and gas ‘load-shedding’ compounds public hardship with winter approaching.\nSensing how vulnerable the government is on this score the opposition has been mounting pressure with countrywide protests. Meanwhile, the PTI government’s relations with the establishment remain strained as frustration grows with its lack of governance. Future support to ‘bail out’ the government is therefore hardly assured. This fraught environment will invite more trouble if government leaders don’t take these varied challenges seriously and continue business as usual in their characteristic hubristic mode.\nRead more:The joint sitting of parliament reflected poorly on the state of democracy in Pakistan\nConfronted with these problems the government still decided to press ahead with laws that obviously do nothing to relieve growing public and political pressure. If anything, the coercive manner of its parliamentary move has left the country more politically polarised and the opposition even more adamant in mobilising people against the government.\nThe government’s most immediate challenge is the economic situation which has imposed such suffering on people as they confrontsoaring pricesand shortages of essential services and commodities. While the government’s economic managers have been holding out the promise of ‘good news’ there is little to suggest that the dire scenario will change for people in any significant way. Resumption of the IMF programme and securing the next tranche is of course necessary to avert a financial crisis. But it will offer little to cheer for people whose cost of living is skyrocketing. Worse, shortages of essential daily-use commodities — which reflect official mismanagement — are also reinforcing public discontent with the government. For their part, official spokesmen have been shirking responsibility for the economic situation, blaming it on predecessor governments and offering hackneyed explanations about ‘mafias’ causing shortages.\nRead more:Statements from govt officials downplaying effects of inflation are only making matters worse\nAs the near-term prospect for improvement in economic conditions and easing in inflation remains grim, this should urge the government to at least seek to defuse political fronts and close others which it has itself gratuitously opened. True it was able to cajole unhappy coalition partners to vote for the amendments but that hardly means it has removed their grievances. In fact, this only reinforced a familiar pattern of government leaders reaching out to allies at a time of urgent need but not paying any attention to them on an ongoing basis or meeting their demands. This suggests that the task of reconciling coalition partners will need the government’s constant attention.\nThis is important given that dissent among political allies was so vocally expressed before the parliamentary session. A key ally even threatened to part ways with the government. Even if coalition partners ultimately fell in line to support the government’s legislation that doesn’t detract from the reality that most of them are now seeking to distance themselves from the PTI with an eye on the general election. That itself reflects their reading that the ruling party is losing public ground and their association with it is becoming a political liability.\nThe PTI government’s triumphal stance after securing the electoral reforms legislation may in fact blindside it to the need to address more pressing economic and political challenges. This of course would be a costly mistake. But its tendency to divert attention from these challenges by blaming either the opposition or ‘mafias’ for the country’s problems indicates that it will continue with such tactics. This would mean minimising what growing economic discontent can morph into especially with a desperate opposition whipping up public sentiment against the government. Navigating a winter of discontent requires a consensual political approach which so far, has eluded the government."}]}

Their first exchange by video since the advent of the Biden administration lasted three and a half hours. It ranged over all the issues on which the world’s two superpowers compete, disagree, collaborate, clash and confront each other — trade, Taiwan, Iran, North Korea, technology, climate change, human rights and strategic weapons. Although no specific outcome emerged from these summit talks it was clear that both sides sought this interaction at the highest level to defuse tensions that seemed to spin out of control in the past several months and sent ties plunging to an unprecedented and perilous low.\nThe effort at de-escalation came as relief to the international community increasingly concerned about the stand-off between the two powers as this involves far-reaching consequences for them, the global economy and international stability. Most countries want to avoid being caught in the cross hairs of this confrontation and do not want to be forced to make a choice between them especially as many, including America’s European allies, have important economic stakes in ties with Beijing.\nRead:UN chief warns China, US to avoid Cold War\nThe Biden-Xi talks marked an acknowledgement by both sides of the need to manage tensions and explore areas where they could cooperate amid what Biden calls “extreme competition”. At the very outset, the American president conveyed to Xi that responsibility obliged them to ensure that competition “does not veer into conflict, whether intended or unintended”. China for its part, has always maintained it wants to stabilise and improve relations while also signalling it would push back hard against provocative US actions. In his opening remarks, Xi told Biden “the world’s two largest economies need to increase communication and cooperation” and he called for a “sound and steady” relationship.\nWill relations stabilise or remain hostage to US insecurity over the rise of a rival superpower?\nSince Biden assumed office, he has pursued a tough line on China, quite indistinguishable from his predecessor Donald Trump’s policy that saw the US impose wide-rangingtrade tariffson Chinese exports, adopt aggressive rhetoric and take steps seen as provocative by Beijing. This hard-line approach has been driven by Washington’s growing fear of a rival superpower’s rising global economic, military and technological power. Biden’s stance also reflects the political consensus in the US that views China as an adversary to be contained and not just competed against.\nThis thinking urged his administration towards moves in recent months that reinforced Beijing’s belief that the US under Biden was continuing with a strategy to contain China. In September 2021, Washington forged a newtrilateral security pactwith the UK and Australia, AUKUS, aimed at enhancing Australia’s naval power by nuclear-powered submarines to counter China’s military ascendancy in the western Pacific. Soon after, the White House hosted leaders of the so-called Quad — comprising US, Australia, Japan and India — to cement an anti-China coalition among regional states. These moves were denounced by Beijing as a threat to regional peace and security. In the virtual summit President Xi warned of the dangerous consequences for global peace of dividing the world into different camps.\nRead:Biden's contain China strategy\nThe Nov 15 meeting appeared to zero in on security and geopolitical issues even though other matters were also discussed. Understandably, as they have driven the recent spike in tensions. An area that reportedly saw modest progress concerned their nuclear arsenals. TheFinancial Timescalled this a breakthrough but that overplays the apparent agreement reached on holding ‘strategic stability’ talks aimed at reducing the risk of nuclear conflict. This may however be imperilled by last week’s US action of placing a dozen Chinese companies on a blacklist ostensibly on ‘national security’ grounds because they aid the Chinese military’s development efforts.\nTaiwan was among the thorniest issues discussed during the meeting, with the Chinese leader warning the US of a strong response if Beijing’s red line was crossed i.e. encouraging “separatist forces” in Taiwan. Xi characterised this as “playing with fire”. Biden conveyed the US position, reflected in the statement later issued by the White House, of opposition to “unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait” — a reference to China’s military movements in the area. The US has itself been stepping up its military presence and sending warships to the region. This fraught situation has aroused concerns among regional states and prompted warnings from leaders, notably Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsein Loong, about the risk of a military clash due to miscalculation between the US and China. Although the US restated its commitment to a ‘one China’ policy in the meeting, Biden’sdecisionto invite Taiwan to its Summit on Democracy next month is another provocative move that has already accentuated tensions with Beijing.\nA rather bland US statement of its readout of the Biden-Xi meeting gave little indication of how Washington expects relations to evolve, other than reiterating “the importance of managing competition responsibly”, albeit a significant goal. The statement issued by China, on the other hand, clarified Beijing’s framework for improving ties. Xi identified three principles and four priorities for China-US cooperation. The three principles to guide future relations were mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. The four priorities he set out are leading the global response to pressing challenges, exchanges at multiple levels to expand cooperation, managing differences to prevent derailment of ties and enhancing collaboration on major international issues.\nThe key question now is whether relations will gradually stabilise between the two countries. Much will depend on whether the Biden administration will continue to follow a contain-China policy that flows from a deeply entrenched Washington view that sees China as a strategic adversary and challenge. It also depends on how accommodating an increasingly assertive China will be of key US priorities. What is hard to determine is how the growing insecurity of an established superpower can be addressed when it sees and is discomforted by its global dominance being challenged by the world’s newest superpower. As Henry Kissinger recently put it, at this historic turning point, the fate of the world may well be decided by the relationship between the US and China."}]}

Having wanted to write about my own diplomatic experience but been deterred by how much I can reveal I marvel at civil servants like Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry who have taken the plunge.\nHis book follows outstanding works by some of his predecessors including Riaz Mohammed Khan and Abdul Sattar. Jamshed Marker’s memoirs were also a rich addition to this literature. The tradition of diplomats writing about foreign policy is important not only to record the history of Pakistan’s external engagements but also learn lessons from how Pakistan navigated the challenges it confronted.\nRead more:External dependence\nAizaz served as foreign secretary at a particularly challenging time. His book deals with Pakistan’s four key relationships — with the US, China, India and Afghanistan. But perhaps the most detailed account is of Islamabad’s tortuous ties with Delhi. This reflects the fact that Aizaz spent a good deal of his 37-year foreign service career dealing with the ups and downs of this adversarial relationship.\nHe describes in a clear and concise way four significant developments in Pakistan-India relations — instituting a structured dialogue in 1997 (cast as “a year of hope”), reviving the peace process in 1998 after nuclear tests by both countries, the disruption caused by the Kargil conflict, and then the peace initiative launched by president Pervez Musharraf in 2004, and the four-point Kashmir formula that emerged from this in 2007.\nIn discussing Pakistan’s decision to test nuclear weapons in June 1998, the author recalls the effort by president Bill Clinton to dissuade prime minister Nawaz Sharif from carrying out tests by making three offers. They were “relief from sanctions under the Pressler Amendment, release of F-16 aircraft Pakistan had already paid for, and provision of economic and security assistance”. Clinton phoned Sharif five times asking him to reconsider. In the fifth call Sharif told him he had no choice but to press ahead. Days later, Pakistan tested and became a nuclear power.\nThe identification of seven foreign policy challenges is a reminder that many still have to be addressed.\nDialogue with India picked up after a hiatus later that year. It was driven, writes Aizaz, by both countries’ acknowledgement of the need to communicate in a nuclear environment. A summit meeting between Sharif and prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly paved the way for resumption of the Composite Dialogue. As conceived a year earlier, this involved six baskets of issues including peace and security, Kashmir and terrorism. This promising framework for talks was to last, albeit in an on-off way, for almost a decade because it covered the entire gamut of issues and reflected the priorities of both sides — Kashmir for Pakistan and terrorism for India.\nNext came the historic visit to Pakistan by Vajpayee in February 1999. Aizaz interprets this as India’s “change of heart” due to “the new balance of power in South Asia prompted by the nuclear tests of the two nations”. Vajpayee, he argues, “might have viewed this to be an opportunity to change the course of history” and address the “mutual mistrust” between the two countries. The Lahore Declaration was signed, which called for “intensifying efforts to resolve all issues, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir”.\nBut the promise of a new era in relations proved short-lived as the Kargil conflict intervened to derail the peace process. This had far-reaching consequences which Aizaz summarises as follows. “It shattered the peace process with India, dented our deterrence by opening the door for India to conceive conventional engagement below the nuclear threshold, and undermined the Kashmir cause by providing India an opportunity to falsely project the Kashmiri freedom struggle as Pakistani-backed terrorism.” He analyses the role played by the US in defusing the Pakistan-India confrontation from his vantage point at Pakistan’s embassy in Washington where he then served. For Washington, Aizaz writes, it was clear Pakistan had to back down and withdraw from the heights to prevent an all-out war. This is what unfolded bringing an end to this unfortunate chapter.\nThe 1999 coup and advent of the Musharraf period followed, but again the description of the military ruler’s peace effort is especially instructive. After several false starts, what the author calls a “breakthrough for peace” came in January 2004 during the Saarc summit in Islamabad, when Musharraf and Vajpayee met and agreed to resume the Composite Dialogue. This created a propitious environment for the most purposeful negotiations on Kashmir in recent decades.\nAlthough this involved backchannel diplomacy that Aizaz was not associated with and a more detailed account is found in former foreign minister Khurshid Kasuri’s book, his summary of what it yielded is noteworthy. “The Four-Point Formula was an interim agreement that envisaged two units comprising the areas controlled by India and Pakistan.” Both would have self-governance in principally finance, law and order and elections. The defence of each unit would be India and Pakistan’s responsibility. Gradual demilitarisation of the region would start with urban centres. A joint mechanism would be established on travel, tourism, trade and disaster management.\nThis Kashmir ‘agreement’ fell victim to political upheaval in Pakistan that eventually led to Musharraf’s downfall. But it serves as a reminder of what serious negotiations can accomplish. The Mumbai bombings in November 2008 put paid to the peace process and brought four years of “bridge building to a grinding halt”. Another fallout, according to Aizaz, was that it led to unprecedented international pressure on Pakistan on the terrorism issue.\nRead more:The long impasse\nThe book’s assessment of Pakistan’s “unwavering partnership” with China, including talks that produced CPEC, roller-coaster ties with the US (marked by “misplaced expectations”) and relations with Afghanistan all shine a light on the challenges Islamabad had to negotiate including aligning civil-military views on these critical relationships. The book is rich in detail for those interested in understanding Pakistan’s foreign policy at a time of changing geopolitical dynamics. The thoughtful epilogue that identifies and analyses seven foreign policy challenges is a reminder that many of these still remain to be addressed."}]}

Many in the West saw this as a timely effort to reinvigorate democracies, put the issue back on the US foreign policy agenda and sharpen the focus on the ‘battle’ against autocracies. Others read the move as another effort in Washington’s counter-China strategy to mobilise democratic states and reinforce the idea that an ideological conflict is to be waged. The latter interpretation strengthened the view that the Biden administration is injecting a ‘cold war’ dimension into its competition with China.\nWhatever the motive there is no getting away from the fact that democracies everywhere face challenges from the rising forces of intolerance. Today democracies in many parts of the world are far from being shining examples of equal liberties for all and respect for institutions and human rights. In fact, most democracies now are in serious disrepair and need to fix their multiple weaknesses and deficiencies. Political polarisation and toxic politics seem to have become a worldwide phenomenon now. This denudes democratic systems of the essential ingredients to make them work effectively — tolerance, consensus and accommodating diverse opinion.\nTheGlobal State of Democracy Report 2021, published by a Sweden-based research institute, highlights what it calls ‘democratic erosion’. It says “the quality of democracy continues to travel a very visible downward path across the board”. Democratic governments, according to the report, have been mimicking the practices of authoritarian regimes and this “democratic backsliding” is “threatening to become a different kind of pandemic”. It “now afflicts very large and influential democracies that account for a quarter of the world’s population”. This at a time when the percentage of people living in a democracy has also plunged to its lowest point since 1991.\nRead:Democracy slipping away at record rate, warns IDEA\nOne of the two most egregious examples of democratic erosion is in our neighbourhood — India, while the other is among the world’s oldest democracies, the US. Indian democracy has in recent years been challenged by the rise of right-wing nationalist populism, also evidenced across the world, with so-called strongmen rule holding sway. This has entailed elected leaders acting with impunity to erode civil liberties, curb freedom of expression, suppress dissent and undermine democratic norms. The perversion of Indian democracy and its descent into authoritarianism has however gone much further with the assault on the state’s formal secularism by the ruling party’s Hindutva ideology and its active mobilisation of anti-Muslim and anti-minority sentiment. This has fuelled violent religious discord and the most vicious mob attacks on minorities.\nRead:India has now become the sick man of South Asia\nDemocratic decline is now a global trend which reflects growing intolerance around the world.\nDemocratic erosion in the US has assumed a different form but has also resulted in regression. The rise of Trumpian populism in recent years has seen the mainstreaming and empowerment of racist and white supremist groups and sentiment that has fuelled racial unrest and deeply divided the country. Moreover, polarisation has steadily eroded the political middle ground, produced partisan gridlock and made even minimal consensus to run the political system elusive, leaving it in a dysfunctional state. Lack of respect for democratic norms and institutions reflected in Trump’s whimsical rule has outlasted him. It is reflected most notably in the way many Republican-run states are makingchanges to election lawsand voting rules. In at least 19 states Republican-controlled state legislatures have enacted laws that restrict voting rights.\nThis has set off alarm bells about the future of democracy in the US. A statement signed earlier this year by over a hundred American scholars warned of the danger to democracy by such actions which were politicising the electoral system and could call into question the fairness and credibility of future elections. The wider public seems to share this view. Two-thirds of Americans believe their country’s democracy is under threat according to a July 2021 PBS/NPR poll.\nThe US is no exception to a global trend also playing out in central Europe where leaders including Victor Orbán in Hungary, Andrzej Duda in Poland and an aspiring ‘elected autocrat’ Herbert Kickl in Austria represent the far right that has manipulated xenophobic nationalism and mobilised anti-immigration sentiment to seize power. Then there is Brazil’s far right populist President Jair Bolsonaro in Latin America’s largest democracy. Many such populists once they are elected concentrate power, subvert democracy and engage in reckless politics and authoritarian practices.\nThe trend towards authoritarianism in the last decade or more raises the question of what are the underlying factors responsible for the phenomenon and rise of populist leaders. This cannot be attributed to any uniform set of factors as each country’s case is different with specific dynamics and variables shaping its political trajectory and landscape. Some common features can nevertheless be identified. They include the failure of established political parties and their policies to meet heightened public expectations, growing disconnect between political elites and people, poor governance, increasing inequality, lack of responsiveness by institutions to public concerns, political polarisation, economic and social discontent, uncertainties spawned by globalisation and role of the social media.\nWhat about Pakistan’s democratic record? The country’s chequered political history has seen it alternate between periods of fragile democracy and long bouts of military rule. The post-1980s democratic experience has been replete with ousters of elected governments, well short of completing their term, by military-backed actions undertaken either by previously powerful presidents or the judiciary. In such an environment democratic values and norms could barely take root while the politics of intolerance practised by several civilian governments also played into the hands of the ubiquitous establishment. Today Pakistan’s democracy has an elected government but in a political system popularly known as ‘hybrid’, to indicate the influence exercised by the military over national affairs and governance. This has further distorted the working of democracy. So have the actions of a government that treats political opposition as illegitimate, shows little tolerance for criticism or dissent and prefers to rule unilaterally. Pakistan’s democracy has regressed in recent years but for reasons somewhat different from those challenging democracy elsewhere. What it has in common with democratic decline across the world is an environment of growing intolerance that is both a cause and consequence of democratic erosion."}]}

The political temperature will rise exponentially and the environment will also be more fraught with reinforcement of prevailing trends. The year 2021 saw greater polarisation and divisive politics in the country, mounting tensions between the government and opposition and extremist forces calling the shots in confrontations with the authorities.\nThe economic challenge intensified. Inflation soared and shortages of essential commodities and services multiplied, especially gas supplies. Financing gaps increased in the government’s budget and the country’s trade account.Delayover an IMF programme eroded business confidence and dampened stock market sentiment. This gloomy scenario was reflected in rising public discontent and concern about the future. A Consumer Confidence Survey by IPSOS, a Paris-based research firm, found 87 per cent of people felt the country was going in the wrong direction in late 2021.\nRead more:Most Pakistanis believe country is headed in wrong direction: Ipsos survey\nPerhaps the most unedifying aspect of 2021’s raging government-opposition confrontation was how it produced a political discourse in which invective and incendiary rhetoric eclipsed any meaningful discussion of policy issues. Political leaders spent more time vilifying their opponents than articulating their position and how to address the country’s challenges. Those in power seemed to equate government performance with demonising rivals while opposition leaders returned the compliment by using similar tactics. The tone and content of political discourse plunged to new depths of incivility. Bitter polemics and shallow and provocative narratives put paid to any reasoned debate. This evoked public disdain for both sides and degraded the country’s democracy.\nRead more:The rising strain in Centre-Sindh relations points to a larger problem\nIf parliament’s role is deemed to be an important indicator of the health of democracy this too did not inspire much confidence. Parliament was mostly reduced to a rubber stamp by the ruling party with the opposition unable to mount meaningful resistance. The most stunning demonstration came last month whenover 30 bills were passed, including an electoral amendment to permit electronic voting machines, without debate and in a matter of just hours. This set a new record for legislating without consensus.\nOutgoing year’s trends do not indicate an optimistic outlook for Pakistan’s politics & economy in 2022.\nThe hybrid political system continued to hold sway with occasional indications of civil-military disagreements. Themost significantwas over the appointment of the head of Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency. However, it was the overall impact of this arrangement on the polity that had significant implications for both democracy and the army’s reputation. Because the government repeatedly relied on the establishment to cobble together majorities for parliamentary votes and maintain its coalition this prevented it from learning the political skill of managing the legislature, building consensus and accommodating other views. This and other forms of behind-the-scenes political activism by the military weakened its claim of neutrality and undermined its traditional role of arbiter.\nThe opposition appeared directionless and in disarray for much of the past year. Formed as an alliance of 11 parties, PDM was weakened with the exit of PPP and ANP. It never recovered and its subsequent activities, despite their sound and fury, posed little challenge to the government. The two major opposition parties also offered few solutions to the country’s problems. The biggest party, PML-N was unable to reconcile the ‘divide within’ between two divergent approaches and narratives and decide whether it wanted to pursue a confrontational or conciliatory approach towards the military establishment. It has to resolve this dilemma well ahead of elections.\nFor the ruling party, Punjab remained its Achilles heel, with a weak and lacklustre provincial leadership unable to provide an effective administration. Its poor management produced internal party discord and contributed significantly to PTI losing political ground in the province — the make-or-break battleground in general elections.\nThe overall lack of governance at the centre also contributed to political setbacks faced by the ruling party in by-elections. It continued to muddle through and govern unilaterally without a clear direction. Morality lectures rather than focus on policy priorities seemed to increasingly preoccupy its leadership. However, two initiatives by the government that were widely appreciated were expansion of the Ehsaas programme and introduction of the health card in Punjab and KP. Aiming to help the underprivileged, these programmes brought credit to the government.\nThe most important and consequential issue that dominated 2021 was the deteriorating state of the economy despite a modest recovery following the government’s Covid-related stimulus measures. Political uncertainty and looming elections complicated the economic situation deterring both domestic and foreign investment. Delay in resuming the IMF programme depleted foreign exchange reserves, put pressure on the rupee and eroded market confidence. Inflation became a politically explosive issue, rising significantly for a combination of reasons, including supply side and monetary factors, while unrestrained subsidy schemes also contributed to it.\nHigh inflation is likely to persist undermining the benefit of four per cent growth projected for the coming year. The global dislocation of supply chains will also add to economic difficulties. All this will exact a political cost for a government going into elections. So will prior actions it is obliged to take — although necessary — such as raising electricity tariffs, to access IMF money.\nThe outgoing year also saw mounting government debt, both internal and external, with public debt rising to over 90pc of GDP. Power sector debt also rose exponentially, compounding the circular debt problem which still awaits meaningful resolution. The fragile macroeconomic situation will continue to be challenging in 2022 with the persistence of negative trends especially a high fiscal deficit, low foreign exchange reserves (due to debt service requirements), growing current account deficit and stagnant private investment levels. The use of bank credit to finance the public sector will continue to crowd out private investment with detrimental effects on the economy.\nOnce the IMF programme resumes in the coming year it will ease the country’s balance of payments difficulties. But more structural reforms will be needed to unlock funds from other multilateral and bilateral donors. Fiscal vulnerabilities will remain and will have to be carefully managed as will domestic and external risks to the economy in 2022. It will however be the government’s ability to bring down inflation that will be the decisive economic factor in determining its political fortunes with elections approaching."}]}

Does it indicate the shape of things to come for local elections elsewhere in the country and general elections little over a year away? Were only ‘local’ factors in play that may not hold in national elections? Is grassroot opinion turning against the incumbent party? Are voters, burdened by inflation, in a punishing mood across the country?\nThere is little doubt that the local bodies election was a stunning blow for the Imran Khan government. KP has long been PTI’s bastion of power. Few predicted it would do so poorly in a province it runs. The first phase of local government elections in 17 provincial districts saw PTI come a distant third on more than half the seats. It trailed behind JUI-F in many contests. Not only did PTI lose mayoral elections and many tehsil chairmen’s seats but its failure to win the mayor’s post in Peshawar was little short of a debacle as the party had scooped up all the national and provincial seats from the city in 2018. JUI-F’s electoral success is one of the surprising comebacks in recent Pakistani politics.\nRed Zone Files:With its fortress breached, the PTI may now find itself fighting for its political survival\nPrime Minister Imran Khan was quick toacknowledgethe setback attributing it to mistakes that exacted a political price. In a tweet he maintained that “wrong candidate selection was the major cause” and added that for the second phase of polls, he would personally supervise PTI’s election strategy. Some ministers saw party infighting as the main reason for failure. A senior minister said, “When three to four candidates from the same party contest the polls in the same constituency, then the party will [inevitably] lose the election.” Others called for addressing the party’s “shortcomings”. Dissident PTI MNAs from KP went further and claimed they saw this coming given their party’s poor governance and failure to control inflation. They also said their warnings to the leadership were ignored as was the growing alienation of party workers.\nVoters are unforgiving about what they see as lack of government performance. Skyrocketing prices especiallyfood inflationwas the key factor for rising discontent with PTI’s government as reflected in the KP electoral outcome. Acknowledged by several ministers as a principal cause this has important implications for the party’s electoral fortunes in the general election. There are other factors too. In fact, a combination of reasons lies behind its dismal performance. Weak and lacklustre provincial leadership is one. The PTI team in the province, like the one the prime minister has positioned in Punjab, has not distinguished itself for providing an effective administration or having a strong grip on the party.\nA house divided against itself in times of economic discontent exacted a political cost in KP’s election.\nWith intense factionalism and bitter inhouse rivalries afflicting the provincial party, this led PTI candidates to work against each other in the election. Denied tickets, many party members defied party discipline to contest as independents. A house divided against itself in an environment of economic discontent produced predictable results.\nSeveral traits the party and its leadership have acquired — laid bare by the KP polls — can be consequential for how the party fares in future elections. First, the prime minister’s inability to find time to focus on party matters, which he has now implicitly admitted. He has taken little interest over the past couple of years in managing the party. That has translated into an inability to motivate his team and keep it together. Political management hasn’t been a skill PTI leaders have learnt or honed. Nor have efforts been made to institute party discipline. This was on display in the KP election when multiple PTI candidates vied for the same seat. It is also reflected at the national level in unchecked inhouse rivalries and clashes among senior leaders that often spill over into the public domain. Ministers routinely contradict each other, often making public statements at odds with the leadership’s position. This makes for an ill-disciplined party and lack of cohesiveness. This has a political cost in elections and has contributed to the party’s defeat in successive national and provincial by-elections.\nThe absence of Jahangir Khan Tareen, architect of PTI’s election strategy in 2018 and a quintessential organisation man, has become more telling as time has gone by. The political vacuum he left has not been filled by any leader with the outreach capability, humility and energy that Tareen displayed, which earned him wide respect. Instead, senior PTI leaders have become increasingly disconnected from the party’s grassroot support, and spend more time projecting themselves than serving the party. A striking phenomenon is how they vanish when their government faces a crisis or challenge.\nRead:Looking for a JKT\nAnother aspect of the party relates to weak provincial heads and uninspiring and unempowered chief ministers in KP and Punjab. They lack both political skills and the stature needed to rally, unify and strengthen the party in their provinces. Their stultifying management has already contributed to the party losing significant political ground in the two provinces. PTI’s own provincial lawmakers see these chief ministers holding office not due to any intrinsic merit or competence but because the prime minister prefers pliant figures who can be controlled from Islamabad. Such leaders at the helm put the party at a political disadvantage, as amply testified by electoral setbacks PTI has faced in both provinces and in Punjab’s cantonment board elections.\nOf course, incumbency has its own disadvantages especially when the economic situation has worsened with soaring inflation, gas load-shedding and shortages of essential commodities. Economic hardship has emerged as the single most important reason for growing public disaffection with the PTI government. Little improvement in the economic situation is expected in the near term. In this challenging environment, the prime minister will have to do more than personally supervise the campaign for crucial local bodies elections in Punjab and the second phase of local polls in KP. With general elections also approaching PTI needs an entire organisational overhaul, change in provincial leaderships and a course correction that above all includes crafting a credible message about its future purpose in governance. Without that the party may be over sooner than its leaders think."}]}

But he concludes tellingly that the virus will remain deadly in the developing world while rich countries will extricate themselves from Covid.\nTrends point to an unsettled world with global solidarity and leadership in short supply.\nThe lack of global solidarity witnessed during the pandemic is another trend likely to persist in many areas this year. Despite assertions by the world’s big powers to strengthen multilateralism and international cooperation, the reality has been different with competition rather than collaboration being the dominant dynamic. Countries’ preoccupation with domestic problems will also weaken global cooperation. The annual Strategic Survey by the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies identifies “the cooperation gap in various key areas” as a top trend which is already evident. But it also cites some “cooperation successes” including the new START treaty and COP26 (on climate change). The larger picture, however, is of dynamics driving greater division in the world. In similar vein, theFinancial Timesin a recent editorial described “serious failings of international coordination and cooperation” as a danger in the context of the pandemic. But this is also more widely applicable to a world where the key strategic driver of events is tensions between big powers. Far from abating these have intensified — a trend also expected to assert itself in the year ahead. East-West tensions will continue to contribute to an increasingly fragmented international system.\nRead more:China brands US democracy ‘weapon of mass destruction’\nThe world’s most consequential relationship is that between the US and China. The course of relations between them will be the most significant geopolitical dynamic in 2022. Their confrontation may take a more dangerous turn iftensions over Taiwanspin out of control despite efforts to manage them by high-level bilateral contacts. Most assessments see tensions between them as a top risk with their tech war leading to increasing bifurcation of the digital world. One result of their competition, according to Ian Bremmer, head of the Eurasia group, would be “a decoupling of the vying powers and a world where nations become more commercially aligned with either China or the United States”. This in fact may be a key question this year — whether many countries will be obliged to fall into alignments with one or the other even if they may not want to choose between them.\nA weak geopolitical order is a trend forecast by Control Risks, a UK-based consultancy group. It sees this as emerging from the absence of a dominant global power that sets the terms and conditions for global trade and international security. This in turn has resulted from “America’s broader retreat into domestic concerns and pivot towards further east” as also “symbolised by its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan”. One consequence is increased chances of regional or local intra-state conflicts erupting or intensifying. The IISS survey for example sees this trend epitomised by Ethiopia’s internal conflict. Others see possibilities of longer-standing regional flashpoints threatening international stability.\nTechnological shifts will continue by leaps and bounds even as Big Tech will be exposed to greater scrutiny for both its monopolistic practices and harmful content. TheWall Street Journaldescribed this as one of last year’s main tech events that will shape the future. TheEconomistreport calls it a Techlash. Even so, the digital world that became so pervasive in people’s lives in the pandemic will continue to influence the way people work, communicate, entertain themselves and shop.\nAnother trend is of escalating humanitarian crises in different parts of the world which is highlighted in several assessments especially by UN agencies. Humanitarian needs are expected to reach a record level in the year ahead, the result of a combination of conflict, pandemic and climate change. The UN’s relief agency OCHA has launched an appeal for an unprecedented $41 billion to help 183 million people who need life-saving assistance across the world. Among these thedire situation in Afghanistanstands out, which has been worsening despite recent international efforts to step up humanitarian aid. The geopolitical consequences of a humanitarian catastrophe are all too apparent. In its list of the top 12 risks for 2022 the Washington-based Atlantic Council points to the danger of state collapse in Afghanistan with far-reaching repercussions for the world.\nThe likely trends in 2022 mean that the world will remain in an unsettled and volatile phase in which overlapping challenges will test governments at a time when international solidarity and leadership will be in short supply."}]}

Relations with China and the US while navigating the Sino-US confrontation, dealing with Afghanistan’s uncertainties, managing the adversarial relationship with India and balancing ties between strategic ally Saudi Arabia and neighbour Iran.\nPakistan has to pursue its diplomatic goals in an unsettled global and regional environment marked by several key features. They include rising East-West tensions, increasing preoccupation of big powers with domestic challenges, ongoing trade and technology wars overlying the strategic competition between China and the US, a fraying rules-based international order and attempts by regional and other powers to reshape the rules of the game in their neighbourhood.\nRead more:A troubled world in 2022\nUnderstanding the dynamics of an unpredictable world is important especially as unilateral actions by big powers and populist leaders, which mark their foreign policy, have implications for Pakistan’s diplomacy. In evolving its foreign policy strategy Pakistan has to match its goals to its diplomatic resources and capital. No strategy is effective unless ends and means are aligned.\nPakistan’s relations with China will remain its overriding priority. While a solid economic dimension has been added to long-standing strategic ties, it needs sustained high-level engagement and consultation to keep relations on a positive trajectory. CPEC is on track, but there are issues to address in its second phase. They include simplifying cumbersome bureaucratic approval procedures for investors, resolving the issue of deferred payments to IPPs and promoting more business-to-business cooperation. Chinese concerns about security of their per­­sonnel working in Pakistan also need to be ad­­d­ressed. As the pivot of China’s belt and road initiative — the 21st century’s most ambitious econo­mic enterprise — CPEC’s timely progress is crucial to re­­­inforce Beijing’s interest in strengthening Pakistan, economically and strategically. Close coordination with Beijing on key issues remains important.\nPakistan’s strategy must align ends with means and its goals to its diplomatic capital.\nPakistan wants to improve ties with the US. But relations will inevitably be affected by Washington’s ongoing confrontation with Beijing, which American officials declare has an adversarial dimension while China attributes a cold war mindset to the US. Islamabadseeks to avoid being suckedinto this big power rivalry. But this is easier said than done. So long as US-China relations remain unsteady it will have a direct bearing on Pakistan’s effort to reset ties with the US especially as containing China is a top American priority.\nUS withdrawal from Afghanistan has diminished Pakistan’s importance for Washington for now, at a time when many in the US blame Islamabad for its military debacle in Afghanistan. For almost two decades Afghanistan was the principal basis for engagement in their frequently turbulent ties, marked by both cooperation and mistrust. As Pakistan tries to turn a new page with the US the challenge is to find a new basis for a relationship largely shorn of substantive bilateral content. Islamabad’s desire to expand trade ties is in any case contingent on building a stronger export base.\nRead more:Pakistan desires relationship with US that is in sync with its 'changed priorities': Qureshi\nComplicating this is Washington’s growing strategic and economic relations with India, its partner of choice in the region in its strategy to project India as a counterweight to China. The implications for Pakistan of US-India entente are more than evident from Washington turning a blind eye to the grim situation in occupied Kashmir and its strengthening of India’s military and strategic capabilities. Closer US-India ties will intensify the strategic imbalance in the region magnifying Pakistan’s security challenge.\nMultiple dimensions of Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan will preoccupy Islamabad, which spent much of 2021 engaged with tumultuous developments there. While Pakistan will continue to help Afghanistan avert a humanitarian and economic collapse it should not underestimate the problems that may arise with an erstwhile ally. For one, the TTP continues to be based in Afghanistan and conduct attacks from there. Theborder fencing issueis another source of unsettled discord. Careful calibration of ties will be needed — assisting Afghanistan but avoiding overstretch, and acknowledging that the interests of the Taliban and Pakistan are far from identical. Moreover, in efforts to mobilise international help for Afghanistan, Islamabad must not exhaust its diplomatic capital, which is finite and Pakistan has other foreign policy goals to pursue.\nManaging relations with India will be a difficult challenge especially as the Modi government is continuing its repressive policy in occupied Kashmir and pressing ahead with demographic changes there, rejecting Pakistan’s protests. The hope in establishment circles that last year’s backchannel between the two countries would yield a thaw or even rapprochement, turned to disappointment when no headway was made on any front beyond the re-commitment by both neighbours to observe a ceasefire on the Line of Control.\nWorking level diplomatic engagement will continue on practical issues such as release of civilian prisoners. But prospects of formal dialogue resuming are slim in view of Delhi’s refusal to discuss Kashmir. This is unlikely to change unless Islamabad raises the diplomatic costs for Delhi of its intransigent policy. Islamabad’s focus on Afghanistan last year meant its diplomatic campaign on Kashmir sagged and was limited to issuing tough statements. Unless Islamabad renews and sustains its international efforts with commitment and imagination, India will feel no pressure on an issue that remains among Pakistan’s core foreign policy goals.\nWith normalisation of ties a remote possibility, quiet diplomacy by the two countries is expected to focus on managing tensions to prevent them from spinning out of control. Given the impasse on Kashmir, an uneasy state of no war, no peace is likely to continue warranting Pakistan’s sustained attention.\nIn balancing ties with Saudi Arabia and Iran, Pakistan should consider how to leverage possible easing of tensions between the long-standing rivals — of which there are some tentative signs. With Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman keen to use economic power to expand his country’s diplomatic clout by making strategic overseas investments, Pakistan should use its political ties with Riyadh to attract Saudi investment through a coherent strategy. Relations with Iran too should be strengthened with close consultation on regional issues especially Afghanistan. The recent barter agreement is a step in the right direction.\nIn an increasingly multipolar world, Pakistan also needs to raise its diplomatic game by vigorous outreach to other key countries and actors beyond governments to secure its foreign policy goals."}]}

TheMurree tragedylaid bare multiple fault lines — negligence and mismanagement by the authorities, lack of urgent response, failure of the National Disaster Management Authority, denial of administrative culpability, evasion of responsibility, absence of official contrition, ministerial arrogance in the face of public criticism and a characteristic blame-the-victim stance of the country’s chief executive.\nWhen a tragedy strikes anywhere in the world, government leaders swiftly emerge to assume responsibility and to show seriousness over what has happened. That usually helps to allay public anger and show empathy, commitment to prevent such incidents and — above all — willingness to accept responsibility. That is what is expected of leadership. But in this case a tweet is all that emanated from the prime minister. No public appearance to express sorrow, no statement in parliament or visibility elsewhere and no effort to personally reach out to those who lost their loved ones in this avoidable tragedy. Only an inquiry wasannouncedin a perfunctory manner.\nAs for the tweet, it attracted justified flak for blaming the victim, stating as it did that people should have checked the weather before embarking upon the fateful journey. As if no responsibility rested with the local or provincial authorities to “check the weather”, take action to regulate traffic and deploy snow clearing machinery in view of a snowstorm forecast days earlier by the Met department. The authorities had a week to take preventive measures. But no weather warning was issued by them for a town just over an hour away from the capital. Nor was action taken by the local administration to halt traffic whose volume was easily determined at the toll barrier. When disaster struck, no help was available for over 24 hours. Officials failed to respond to people’s calls for help. This was all confirmed by survivors.\nRead:ASI, family stranded in Murree amid heavy snowfall hoped against hope for help\nCompounding this tragedy was the conduct of Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar who remained distracted by a party reorganisation meeting while stranded people froze to death or were asphyxiated in snow-buried cars. The stance of the federal ministers also brought no credit to the government. Several made statements focusing on the opposition’s criticism rather than on the tragedy itself. Hours before the incident, a minister bragged that 100,000 cars going to Murree was indication of growing public prosperity. The same minister bettered his own record of making disingenuous statements when he later told parliament that the tragedy was the result of corruption by opposition leaders who did nothing for the development of Murree when in power. He didn’t, of course, say what his own government had done for over three years. In any case the catastrophe was principally the result of the failure by authorities to issue a timely warning about an impending snowstorm and stopping cars from going to the hill station. After all the Lahore-Islamabad highway is routinely closed due to the winter fog so why couldn’t cars similarly have been prevented from going up the winding road to Murree?\nIf all negative developments are someone else’s fault, what is government there for?\nIt took a tragedy to again demonstrate how the government constantly passes the buck to others for its responsibility. Notwithstanding the ruling party’s claims to be the only one that serves the people, it never manages to show empathy for victims — whether of a natural disaster, a man-made one or a situation of economic hardship — with senior leaders barely surfacing beyond posting token tweets. This lack of a common touch is paradoxical for a party that used populism to ride to power.\nThe habit of blaming others for any problem, tragedy or setback has now become ingrained in the PTI government. It has been evidenced on a number of fronts but perhaps the most consequential is that of the economy. Although the evasion of responsibility on this count obviously raises completely different issues than those raised by the Murree incident, it reflects a similar attitude.\nRead:Tragedy in Murree and how we can prevent such calamities in the future\nA government in its fourth year in power still rails and rants that the deteriorating state of the economy is the fault of predecessor governments. This is not to say that the underlying or structural sources of the country’s chronic budget and balance of payments deficits emerged recently. In fact, just about every government since the mid-1980’s inherited an economic legacy of growing financial imbalances and mounting debt. But it is the responsibility of those in power to address and rectify this, and not reinforce or compound these weaknesses. That is the test of government and why voters elect it in the first place — to solve problems, not moan about what it inherited.\nPTI promised a decisive break from the past, epitomised by its ‘tabdeeli’ slogan. Thus, its government was supposed to live up to expectations it had itself raised. Nowhere was this more important than in the area of economic management. But did it depart from the past? Not so, as it continued to meet financing gaps by borrowing and driving up debt rather than mobilising adequate domestic resources. It failed to significantly tackle, much less reverse, fundamental macroeconomic weaknesses — high fiscal deficit, low foreign exchange reserves (owing to debt service requirements), rising current account deficit, and low savings and private investment levels. That is what has now compelled the government to seek an IMF bailout, which means following a well-worn path.\nNor has the government been able to create a business-friendly environment given its ‘accountability’ mantra, its constant diatribes against business ‘mafias’ as well as encouraging NAB to go into overdrive. But rather than own up to its responsibility, its narrative assigned blame for the deteriorating economic situation to previous governments. The high inflation — the most pernicious tax on the poor — to which its policies contributed was also laid at the door of others. Such explanations and references to inflation levels in other countries are little comfort to anxious citizens. Denying responsibility does little to reassure the public that the government is up to tackling the problem.\nIf all negative developments are the fault of others — whether it is a tragedy attributed to people who travelled “without checking the weather” or a deteriorating economic situation that is owed to others — then what is the government for?"}]}

Offering a comprehensive approach by placing as much emphasis on the security of citizens as state security is a welcome initiative. This has long been urged by many in the country who pointed out that the security of a country can neither be assured nor be meaningful for citizens without human security — a concept originating in the early 1990s, which Dr Mahbubul Haq translated into an implementable and measurable goal in a path-breaking UNDP document in 1994.\nThe notion has figured for years in power point presentations at the National Defence University here and academic institutions elsewhere. But it was never formally embraced or acted upon by Pakistan’s security managers. The key question now is whether the government has a strategy to implement human security or indeed the NSP’s other lofty objectives. Seeking to be all-encompassing thedocumentlists numerous well-known challenges but without identifying credible and executable policies to achieve objectives. Instead, it offers a series of platitudes. A policy document must align goals with resources and capacity, and ends with means so that it is in sync with realities. That’s what makes policy enforceable.\nThe NSP disappoints because it states objectives without indicating a strategy, goals without specifying means to secure them and aims without identifying criteria for deliverables. Long on verbiage it is short on ideas. It is silent on allocation of responsibilities to promote the goals it sets. Who will align the varied goals? It should also have been able to show how national security challenges overlap and are interconnected and how an integrated approach is to be crafted and implemented to set off a virtuous cycle. It claims to provide an overall policy direction but does so in a generalised and superficial way. It is as if a tick-the-boxes approach is adopted, which treats issues in a cursory manner and leaves priorities unclear.\nConsider the NSP’s emphasis on making the economy the pivot of national security — a welcome reaffirmation but not entirely a new undertaking as economic stability has long been paramount for policymakers. The renewed emphasis required indicating how this goal would be promoted including a commitment to take tough decisions to reorder budget priorities and launch serious reforms. But one looks in vain for this in the document. After all the structural sources of Pakistan’s chronic financial imbalances are well known. Governments have for decades lived beyond their means and relied on domestic and foreign borrowing to meet financing gaps in both the budget and balance of payments. Ruling elites have shown no political will to raise domestic resources while refusing to tax themselves. Meanwhile, large defence expenditures have pre-empted spending on human development — education and health — in a trade-off with obvious implications for ‘economic security’.\nRead:How will the government implement Pakistan's National Security Policy?\nThe national security policy is long on verbiage but short on ideas.\nWhile declaring the intent to place the economy at the core of national security, the NSP doesn’t focus on the crux of Pakistan’s economic weakness much less on how to address it especially by urging a change in budget priorities. It devotes few sentences to fiscal management and states only this about the goal: “a manageable fiscal deficit through a consistent increase in government revenues requires continued focus on tax reforms.” But it offers no ideas, no ‘direction’ on what this involves. If the economy is to be the pivot of national security — and it should — the NSP should have spelt out how this aim would be secured. Goals such as increase exports, achieve sustainable growth and secure energy supplies are set out but these have long figured as declarations of intent in almost every official economic document. As implementation is everything, it is necessary to explain how goals are to be achieved. Absent that, objectives remain little more than a wish list.\nThree other challenges with enormous economic and security impact are dealt with in passing — population growth, extremism and the education deficit. The demographic challenge is consequential to Pakistan’s security for reasons that need little elaboration. But the NSP doesn’t prioritise population control. Even though it cites annual population growth at 2.4 per cent it refers only fleetingly to “population management” in the context of sustainable development. Extremism is dealt with in a perfunctory manner despite being among Pakistan’s top security challenges. A few prosaic phrases are offered as a response. Education, which lies at the heart of most of Pakistan’s problems, is mentioned in the section on securing the economic future but it too doesn’t receive the priority it should. Pakistan still has the world’s second highest number of out-of-school children, 22 million. Yet the NSP ‘guideline’ simply calls for quality education to ensure global competitiveness. This aim is already compromised by the government’s controversialsingle national curriculumpolicy.\nThe section on foreign policy shows a lack of ideas and imagination. It would certainly have benefited from a description, albeit brief, of the unsettled international environment which forms the backdrop to the conduct of Pakistan’s foreign policy with wide-ranging implications for both its geopolitical and geo-economic strategies. The NSP mentions growing militarisation but as consequential for the country are trade and tech wars between big powers that are dividing the global economy and bifurcating the supply chain and the digital world. The document lists Pakistan’s principal bilateral relationships saying little about how to manage or balance them in an era of shifting geopolitics and multipolarity. It does not indicate strategic priorities while regurgitating the old theme of leveraging Pakistan’s location to advance its interests, which however are not clearly spelt out. Surprisingly the NSP doesn’t mention the crucial role of soft power in promoting Pakistan’s diplomatic goals. Only two policy guidelines are offered which are generalised formulations of what every country seeks to do anyway, for example, “cultivate broad-based relationships”.\nThe NSP correctly places emphasis on national cohesion as a key determinant of security. This is ironic coming from a government that has never acted on this and failed to build national consensus for the NSP. After all, if all provinces are not brought on board, implementation of any policy becomes well-nigh impossible."}]}

Three recent developments indicate the PTI government’s growing nervousness and apprehension about its political future and cast renewed doubt about its ability to lead for the remaining duration of its term. Prime Minister Imran Khan’sangry responsesduring a live public phone-in session, the unceremoniousdepartureof his government’s so-called accountability czar and growing voices of dissent within the ruling party all signal a government that is increasingly beleaguered and rattled by rising political and economic pressures.\nFirst, the prime minister’s remarks that have been the subject of much media comment and fuelled intense political speculation. From defending his government’s economic record in the face of rising public anger with soaring inflation, the prime minister kept veering off track to assail the opposition and repeat his familiar mantra about never engaging with corrupt opposition leaders. This tirade included an assertion that he did not recognise Shehbaz Sharif as parliamentary leader of the opposition.\nFaced with challenges, the PM needs to repurpose his government and recast his team and party organisation.\nMore significant and what made headlines was his warning that if he was forced out of power he would be much more dangerous for his opponents. “If I take to the streets, you will have nowhere to hide,” he said. This sparked a wave of media speculation about who this was directed against. The political opposition or the establishment that he has long relied on for support? Had the prime minister fallen prey to conspiracy theories doing the rounds about efforts to destabilise his government even though entirely unfounded? While this remained in the realm of speculation, what his statement did signal was a sense of frustration from a leader whose grip on power seems to be waning. The acknowledgement that he could be out of power sent a signal of weakness rather than confidence. And criticising the media and even the judiciary reflected how isolated he seemed to feel.\nQuick on the heels of this came the resignation of his adviser Shahzad Akbar, the lynchpin of the government’s accountability drive, who has been targeting opposition leaders for the past three years but without making much headway or securing any major conviction. That in fact seemed to seal his fate with the prime minister reportedly unhappy with his performance and forcing him to step down. This marked an admission of nothing less than failure of what has been the government’s flagship policy in its three years in power. In fact, accountability of the corrupt was the PTI’s most important election promise and has been its principal narrative in office. It has also spent more time and energy on this than any other endeavour in power.\nEditorial:Failure of accountability\nBut while the government was embarked on this drive, now set back by circumstances surrounding Akbar’s ouster and the latestTransparency International report, it was people’s increasing economic hardship that concerned them most. As inflation soared and gas shortages hit households and businesses, economic discontent intensified. Several opinion polls reflected growing public dissatisfaction with the government. Under increasing pressure, the government launched assorted spokesmen to explain that inflation was a global phenomenon but this rationale offered little comfort to people in economic distress. Indeed, it became increasingly apparent that public support had begun to significantly erode for both Khan and his government as a consequence of the rising cost of living. An irate prime minister struggled to respond to callers’ questions about inflation in the phone-in which showed how pressured he felt, in recognition of the fact that this was exacting a heavy political price.\nRed Zone Files:Why the PTI has failed to manage perceptions, even with an army of spokespersons\nAnother political development is the growing expression of dissent within the ruling party as members confront the prospect of elections next year in a situation where voters are anxious or angry about skyrocketing inflation as indeed gas shortages. The much-publicisedoutburstby senior PTI leader Pervez Khattak in a party meeting and the critique delivered by MNA Noor Alam Khan on the floor of the National Assembly are the most recent examples of this. In a stinging rebuke of his party leaders for the economic pain being inflicted on people, Noor Alam said he would raise his voice against inflation and unemployment even if it meant violating party discipline. He was promptly served adisciplinary notice. But party insiders say this is just the tip of the iceberg as many others at different rungs of the party feel the political heat from fraught economic conditions or are disgruntled for other reasons. Even leaders of the government’s key allied parties such as PML-Q have started voicing misgivings. The recent statement by Chaudhry Shujaat that the prime minister is being misled about the situation illustrates this. All this may well be posturing ahead of elections but it suggests that the government has become distanced both from its own political base and erstwhile allies.\nAgainst this backdrop the road ahead to elections for Khan and his party is strewn with hurdles and difficulties. The electoral setback in KP’s local elections urged the prime minister to dissolve all PTI organisations across the country in late December. But new office bearers appointed at the national and provincial level are far from being experienced organisation figures. Moreover, leaving two lacklustre and weak chief ministers in place in Punjab and KP does little to strengthen the party or improve its political prospects.\nThe prime minister needs to reboot and repurpose his government to deal with challenges in fraught economic times and to refurbish its waning image. The accountability narrative has run its course as voters are more interested in their economic well-being than with anything else. The government’s constant preoccupation with demonising the opposition also says nothing about its own performance and what it intends to do in the future. An overhaul of the cabinet is needed as this is the team Khan will take to the general election. In terms of message, team and organisation the ruling party has much work to do before the perception takes wider hold that it is incapable of delivering and unfit to govern."}]}

The combined opposition has a majority, albeit thin, in the upper house of parliament. Despite this and its vociferous opposition to the State Bank autonomy bill it failed to block this in the Senate. To be sure the bill was adopted by a majority of only one with the Senate chairman casting the deciding vote. Even so the defeat suffered by the opposition showed it had mounted a half-hearted effort as eight independent senators, and the leader of the opposition in the Senate, never showed up. This embarrassment urged Yousuf Raza Gilani tooffer to resign. Predictably, this wasn’t accepted by the PPP leader while speculation mounted of collusion between the PPP and the establishment.\nThis wasn’t the first time the opposition faced defeat on key legislation in the Senate. The episode underlined that a motley opposition remains deeply divided. Even at moments it defines as important it is unable to act together or effectively. Indeed, after such setbacks, mutual recriminations between the two largest opposition parties reinforces the lack of unity among them. The Senate defeat also sowed discord within the PPP with memberscalling for actionagainst the group of independent members who sit on opposition benches and voted for the bill but had earlier helped Gilani’s election as opposition leader. More importantly, it undercut the claim and perhaps belief of opposition leaders that they can muster the numbers for a successful vote of no-confidence against the government to bring about an in-house change.\nAfter the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)splitlast year with the exit of the PPP and ANP over disagreements on strategy, the opposition appeared rudderless and in disarray for months on end. It struggled to recover while the two major opposition parties — electoral rivals in any case — spent much energy in criticising each other rather than the gove­rnment in television talk shows. Efforts to unify the opposition came to naught. When both opposition groups saw an opportunity to mount greater pressure on the government, due to public discont­ent with soaring inflation and energy shortages, PDM and PPP announced separate protest marches on the capital. PDM announced a long march aimed at dislodging the government for March 23, while PPP declared it would start its protest march against wor­sening economic conditions on Feb 27. Whether the recent luncheon meeting hosted by PML-N lea­der Shehbaz Sharif and attended by PPP leaders Bila­wal Bhutto-Zardari and Asif Zardari urges their two parties towards a joint strategy remains to be seen.\nEditorial:PML-N and PPP are once again closer to giving the PTI sleepless nights\nApart from opposition parties acting at odds with each other both PPP and PML-N have their own set of challenges to address. The PPP government in Sindh has been engaged in fending off opposition to its local government law from both the MQM and Jamaat-i-Islami. It became embroiled in a confrontation with MQM who accused the Sindh government of taking away key administrative and financial powers from local bodies representatives. The Supreme Courtjudgementthen dealt a blow by restraining the provincial government from whittling down the power of the elected local government in certain areas. Dealing with these challenges has obviously consumed — and divided — the attention of its leaders and affected its effectiveness as opposition at the centre.\nAn effective opposition will need to resolve its internal problems and offer real policy alternatives.\nThe PML-N’s predicament is different. It has yet to resolve the issue of the party’s two divergent stra­ins and narratives — one arguing for a conciliat­ory stance towards the establishment while the other a combative approach. While party ‘electables’ prefer an accommodating stance represented by Shehbaz Sharif many of its voters respond to the hawkish one articulated by Maryam Nawaz, who has sought to give the party a populist aura. If confusion persists on this count, it would be costly for a party otherwise skillful in constituency politics. Other than reconciling this ‘divide within’ the party leadership also has to formally name their prime ministerial candidate at some point with elections just a year away. These unresolved issues have an important bearing on party cohesiveness and effectiveness. Factionalism has already exacted a political price by contributing to the fact that in several by-elections PML-N candidates have won by smaller majorities with rivals polling more votes than previously. This can be consequential in general elections.\nThe opposition also needs to craft and articulate policy alternatives to show how it has better answers to Pakistan’s challenges. Opposition parties have been taking the government to task on a broad range of policy fronts. That of course is what oppositions do everywhere. But they also need to come up with policy ideas and explain their own plans for the future rather than just engage in negative campaigning. PDM and PPP have thus far not done this. Claiming they are more ‘fit to govern’ should oblige them to show why that is the case.\nOn some issues the opposition should demonstrate a sense of responsibility to signal that they can rise above partisan politics to act in the national interest. The country’s fragile economic situation and the urgent need for an IMF programme is one of them. Almost all opposition parties stridently opposed the IMF deal when its leaders know that without that Pakistan would face a crisis of financial solvency. Its terms are tough but both the PPP and PML-N governments were also compelled to implement Fund programmes in the past with equally difficult conditionalities. Also, opposition parties never presented a credible alternative to the IMF arrangement. Interestingly, a recent Pulse opinion survey found that just over half of respondents did not agree with the opposition view that the economy is being handed over to the Fund.\nWhile the government is under economic and political pressure with growing public disenchantment with its poor governance that is no reason for the opposition to ignore its own problems. For the opposition to raise its game and be effective it needs to resolve its internal dilemmas, offer real alternatives to the policies they oppose and unite for shared objectives. Otherwise, all the noise opposition parties make will be just sound and fury signifying little."}]}

It has further intensified East-West polarisation and sent tensions soaring to a new high amidUS warningsthat Russia might invade Ukraine in the coming days. Whether the hour-long phone conversation between the US and Russian presidents on Saturday eases or exacerbates the situation remains to be seen. Reports indicate it was atough exchange.\nThe stand-off between US-led Nato countries and Russia is widely seen to be about the balance of power and security architecture in Europe. President Vladimir Putin, who has witnessed several waves of Nato’s eastward expansion, has now drawn a red line insisting on a halt to more expansion. He regards this as a threat to Russia’s security and intrusion into its ‘sphere of influence’. Among key Russian security demands discussed with the US in abortive diplomatic talks was that Ukraine and other states should be barred from joining Nato, no strategic weapons be deployed in Ukraine and Nato’s presence ended in former Soviet countries. This was turned down by the US and led to suspension of US-Russia talks.\nMeanwhile, a military build-up continued apace. When Russia mobilised tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border, Washington accused Moscow of planning an invasion andwarnedof serious consequences as it began crafting tough economic sanctions aimed at pressurising the Russians. Troops of Nato member states went on high alert while the US sent more military aid and weapons to Ukraine. The Ukraine president cautioned against spreading panic. But President Joe Biden asked American citizens to leave the country, warning of an “immediate threat” and declaring that “things could go crazy quickly”.\nEarlier, at a UN Security Council meeting on Jan 31, the Russian ambassador vehemently denied any plan to militarily intervene in Ukraine and accused Western countries of “pumping Ukraine with weapons”. Days later the Pentagon announced the deployment of 3,000 troops to Poland, Germany and Romania in addition to around 8,000 troops already on standby. For his part, Putin accused the West of using Ukraine as a “tool” to provoke war. His foreign minister said Western countries were spreading “hysteria”.\nThe Ukraine crisis has pushed Russia and China into a tighter embrace and exposed divisions in the West.\nWhat this crisis has already done is to bring Moscow and Beijing into a tighter embrace which some Western analysts are now describing as a China-Russia axis. The meeting between President Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Winter Olympics in Beijing concluded with a strong expression of solidarity and resolve to mount a united front against the US.\nThe Feb 4 joint statement issued after the Xi-Putin meeting was unprecedented in its scope and substance as in its firm rejection of US policies. The crux of the lengthy statement was their common position “against attempts by external forces to undermine security and stability in their common adjacent regions”. In a pointed reference to the US, the statement rejected “unilateral approaches” and interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states. The key priorities of both countries were addressed by the statement. Russia reaffirmed support for the One-China principle and on the Taiwan issue while China joined Russia in opposing Nato expansion and called on the Western alliance “to abandon its ideologised Cold War approaches”. They also criticised Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy and the trilateral security alliance between the US, Australia and UK (AUKUS) for undermining security and spawning an arms race in Asia.\nIn contrast to the growing entente between Russia and China — even though their interests don’t always converge — the Western coalition did not appear united despite vigorous US efforts to rally Europe into forging a common front against Russia. European countries seemed to have differing views about how to respond to Putin not least because the continent is dependent on Russian energy supplies while many states have significant commercial links with Russia. The EU gets almost 40 per cent of its gas imports from Russia. Germany, with over half its imported gas coming from Russia, was faulted for not taking a tougher line and balking at sending arms to Ukraine. On economic sanctions too, European nations differed because most would be hurt by them with serious economic repercussions. Agreement on sanctions has to be forged among EU’s 27 members, which is not easy. Western analysts suggested that some of the scepticism of European allies could also be attributed to being ignored by the US in its decision to withdraw from Afghanistan with the disorderly exit raising questions about American credibility.\nLast month, President Biden acknowledged differences in Nato over the response in case of a “minor incursion” by Russia. US officials however quickly walked back this statement while Biden proclaimed “total unanimity” in the transatlantic alliance. With German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s recent visit to Washington, the US has sought to fortify what is widely described as a weak link in the united front against Russia. The joint press conference by the two leaders, however, showed they were not on the same page on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany that the US wants stopped.\nThediplomatic roleFrance has been playing to defuse tensions reflects much of Europe’s preference to resolve the crisis by diplomatic means and avert conflict. President Emmanuel Macron’s statements about addressing Russia’s security concerns while defending Ukraine’s sovereignty struck a different note from Washington, which has continued to insist that a Russian invasion is imminent. Significantly, Macron argued that “the geopolitical objective of Russia today is not Ukraine, but to clarify the rules of cohabitation with Nato and the EU.” Although his talks with Putin in Moscow did not yield anything concrete it seemed to shift the needle away from conflict. French officials claimed the talks had moved the crisis towards de-escalation with Putin agreeing to continue talks in a spirit of compromise.\nAlthough the crisis is still playing out it has been marked by echoes of the Cold War. The stand-off also reinforces the overarching global dynamic of growing East-West mistrust and confrontation while holding out the prospect of a world increasingly riven into two competing blocs."}]}

A new and more intense phase of political manoeuvring? Stepped up efforts by political parties to mobilise support to strengthen their position in the country’s shifting politics, but with an eye on elections down the road? The opposition testing the waters for a vote ofno-confidenceagainst Prime Minister Imran Khan? Posturing by smaller parties and groups to enhance their leverage in an uncertain political environment?\nIt seems to be all of the above. For his part, Prime Minister Khan appears under pressure. This is indicated by his statements anddecisionto launch a public campaign by addressing rallies across the country, kicking off the first one in Mandi Bahauddin. The PM’s bitter attacks on the opposition suggest he is feeling vulnerable even though he emphatically denies any panic in his party. His anger however is palpable when he accuses opposition leaders of banding together to oust him by a no-confidence vote aimed at evading accountability. This wasevidencedmost recently at the Mandi Bahauddin awami jalsa. Meanwhile, cabinet ministers have scrambled to deny, rather defensively, that any no-confidence move could succeed.\nEditorial:The govt is vulnerable on many fronts and knows it\nThe latest spasm of political activity has been triggered by PML-N leaders reaching out to PPP and others. In the meeting between PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari they agreed to explore the possibility of a no-trust move against the government in the National Assembly. The PDM then announced it would work towards this goal. Sharif’scallon Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain ostensibly to inquire about his health but also meet Pervaiz Elahi showed the opposition on an outreach course with long-time rivals. Engagement with government allies was not limited to PML-Q, which holds the balance of power in Punjab. Sharif also met MQM leaders. Contact is also reported with the powerful Jahangir Khan Tareen (JKT) group which has enough MNAs to play a decisive role in the evolving situation.\nEfforts to explore whether politics can be realigned to support the opposition’s aims are still in an initial, probing stage. Unless the opposition is sure about the required numbers it will obviously not proceed with its no-confidence move — an uphill task in any case. It has yet to determine the time frame for the move. It also has obstacles to overcome, including forging a unified approach among disparate parties with competing interests, agree on strategy and on what comes after, if the motion succeeds. It has to reckon with the country’s history in which a vote of no-confidence has always failed. Failure, after all, will be a big blow to the opposition. What opposition parties are also testing is whether the establishment will be neutral because they see this as a make-or-break factor for success or failure.\nBoth the government and opposition need to recraft their narratives in the country’s shifting politics.\nOpposition activity has nonetheless pushed politics into an unpredictable phase with the political temperature rising by the day. By combining plans for a long march with the threat of a no-confidence motion the opposition wants to generate maximum pressure. Whether or not this move materialises, talk about it has raised the stakes and pushed both the government and opposition into campaign mode. The government’s efforts are focused on keeping its ranks united and coalition partners on its side. It apparently plans to induct more ministers in the cabinet from allied parties. The opposition is trying to woo PTI allies, independent MNAs or those belonging to the JKT group.\nRead:That magic number\nWith an eye on elections, whether held earlier or at their due time next year, the government and opposition are also seeking to rally public support beyond their constituencies. In this endeavour, both sides are burdened by tired rhetoric and need to recast their narrative to appeal more widely. The ruling party’s narrative now sounds like a broken record. It continues to be defined by the ‘all opponents arechorsand corrupt’ mantra and the promise to put them behind bars. That puts the entire accent on demonising the opposition rather than setting out what the government has done in its three years and its plans for the future.\nThe prime minister’s speech at Multan earlier this month at the launch of the health card illustrates this. Rather than make this initiative the dominant — and only — theme, he dwelt on assailing the opposition. This stance overlooks the fact that PTI’s accountability narrative has run its course and people want to know how the ruling party will address the issues that agitate them especially economic worries. The PTI government claims it has taken many initiatives aimed to benefit the underprivileged. It should be making these its principal plank. Instead, a bevy of PTI spokesmen constantly surface on TV to accuse opposition leaders of ‘plunder’.\nIf the governing party needs to craft a fresh narrative so does the opposition. The leaders of a motley group of opposition parties keep defining their narrative by what they oppose rather than what they stand for or have to offer as policy alternatives. In mimicking the ruling party by punctuating their rhetoric with charges of corruption against the government, opposition leaders are hardly raising the public debate. Far better for them to engage ministers in policy debates and lay out solutions to national problems. How would they manage the economy, for example, in such a challenging environment?\nThe focus by both sides on simply attacking the other has contributed to a form of issue-less politics, where instead of the country’s challenges being discussed, politics is reduced to deriding opponents. Both government and opposition have a responsibility to raise the level of discourse, and to articulate people’s concerns and how they propose to address them. With multiple challenges facing the country — inflation, income erosion and unemployment being top public priorities — and new security threats emerging, solutions to these, among others, should be dominant in party platforms.\nBut if the narratives of both sides remain unchanged it will strengthen the public impression that politics is just a power struggle between them, disconnected from issues that affect them and the country’s future. And that the politics of the no-confidence move only serves the opposition’s interests and not the public’s."}]}

After weeks of failed diplomacy to avert this crisis, the situation took a fateful turn when President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and recognised them as independent regions. He thenlauncheda full-scale invasion of Ukraine in violation of international law. This has created a perilous situation with global ramifications.\nThe response from the US-led Western community was swift. Russia’s action was roundly condemned by the US and its allies. Ukraine’s president urged the world to stop the war and vowed to resist the Russian attack. President Joe Biden called Putin an aggressor and said he would have to bear the consequences of war. Calls from across the world urged restraint and de-escalation of the crisis. Putin’s justification for his military action went beyond protecting the Russian-speaking people of Donbas and involved ‘defending Russia from Ukraine’, which he accused the West of using as an instrument to threaten Russia.\nRead:Condemnations, warnings and sanctions: What global leaders are saying as Russia-Ukraine conflict intensifies\nThe crisis had built up over months with Russia amassing tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border. Despite the diplomatic dash to Moscow by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Russia’s core security demands were not met. They included a commitment to bar Ukraine from joining Nato, no deployment of strategic weapons in Ukraine and Nato’s return to its pre-1997 borders. All were rejected by the US and Nato.\nThe question now is whether the West’s response to the Russian invasion, ofcensure and sanctions, will pressure Putin to step back. Before considering this, it is instructive to recall what happened eight years ago, as Putin’s latest move marks a continuation of developments that unfolded in 2014 and led Russia to prise Crimea from Ukraine. The dramatic chain of events was triggered by the ouster of pro-Moscow Ukraine president Viktor Yanukovich, who rejected closer association with the EU, and was forced from office by a popular uprising backed by the West. American officials and politicians had showed up in Ukraine to openly express solidarity with anti-Russian demonstrators.\nThe unfolding crisis has created a perilous situation with global ramifications.\nMoscow reacted furiously, and weeks later, invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea and backed pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. Putin later accused the US of orchestrating Ukraine’s 2014 ‘coup’. A ceasefire agreement — Minsk I — was forged in 2014 to end fighting in Donbas but failed to stick. It was followed by Minsk II mediated by France and Germany in 2015. This involved constitutional changes by Ukraine to accord full autonomy and ‘special status’ to the Russian-speaking regions of Donbas. As Henry Kissinger noted in 2014 “the root of the problem” lay in “efforts by Ukrainian politicians to impose their will on recalcitrant parts of the country first by one faction and then by the other” in a nation with a “polyglot composition”. Minsk II was never fully implemented and marked a lost opportunity. But it remained a touchstone for a peaceful solution.\nWestern sanctions now imposed on Russia aim at crippling its economy. They include limiting its access to international capital markets and freezing its overseas assets. Russian officials dismissed the sanctions and recalled that their country has long faced Western restrictions. Putin has in any case sought to make his economy immune to sanctions by building foreign exchange reserves (over $630 billion) and taking other measures. He can also inflict economic pain on Europe as Russia is the continent’s largest source of oil and natural gas as well as important raw materials.\nAgainst this backdrop, is there space for diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis and find a peaceful resolution? For now, diplomacy seems to be off the table. With Russian forces poised to seize Kyiv andmore sanctionsimposed by Western countries, the diplomatic window has closed. Moscow has offered talks to Ukraine but only if its forces surrender. The beleaguered Ukrainian government has said it is ready for talks with Russia including on a neutral status regarding Nato. But it is now too late for this. Meanwhile, Europe is bracing for the economic fallout of the crisis which will also be consequential for the global economy. Markets are in turmoil, grain shortages loom while the crude oil price has surpassed $100 a barrel. This will intensify inflationary pressures and involve economic pain for the West as for much of the world.\nEditorial:A wiser course is needed to prevent the Ukraine invasion spiralling into a conflict of global proportions\nIt is a moot point now whether this crisis could have been averted if America and its allies had been responsive to Russian security concerns in US-Russia talks in January and earlier. Would an offer of a moratorium on Ukraine’s Nato membership have satisfied Moscow? Several Western analysts have also suggested that Washington erred in encouraging the eastward enlargement of Nato in the late 1990s after the end of the Cold War. Others have pointed out that the US had given Moscow assurances in 1990 at the time of German reunification that Nato would not expand eastwards. This is apparently reflected in declassified American and German documents. Many analysts argue that this unkept promise fuelled Russian grievances over decades.\nHowever, what matters now is how this crisis plays out. A firm assessment is difficult in the midst of an ongoing conflict. It appears that Putin’s goal is to first militarily subdue Ukraine and then bring about regime change. When — and if — military coercion achieves this to then negotiate with the West to reconfigure Europe’s security architecture including Nato deployments in eastern Europe. This plan seems to rest on Moscow’s calculation that beyond sanctions and bluster the West can do little as it is unwilling to commit boots on the ground. Ukraine’s president has already said it has been left alone to fight Russia. With the UN paralysed there is little to deter Putin from the path he has taken. Whether this gambit works or backfires only time will tell. It may turn out to be overreach and a strategic mistake if Russia gets bogged down and faces Ukrainian resistance in the long run as well as anti-war protests at home. But for now, the East-West confrontation is taking a bloody toll on Europe where the post-Cold War order has broken down."}]}

Political instability has been endemic with the country alternating between military interventions and civilian rule. Reforms that could have transformed the country and placed its economy on a high-growth and sustainable trajectory were repeatedly postponed as they would have threatened the ruling elite’s privileges and hold on power. Complicating the quest to address persistent economic, governance and security challenges was the impact of global and regional developments.\nIn fact, the external and internal has been so intertwined in Pakistan’s history as to multiply challenges and leave the country in a constant crisis management mode. The country’s ability to weather global and regional geopolitical storms was repeatedly tested. Dealing with their fallout for protracted periods from a state of economic and political fragility ended up emaciating and exhausting Pakistan.\nNow a bold new book seeks to tell the Pakistan story from a new perspective. Mohammed Waseem is among Pakistan’s leading intellectuals and brings his many years in academia to bear on a work rich in insights. His latest bookPolitical Conflict in Pakistandeploys, as its title indicates, the analytical construct of conflict to consider the country’s political experience in multiple dimensions. This is predicated on the hypothesis that political conflict in a postcolonial state like Pakistan is pervasive and the root of “a permanent crisis of governance”. This is because of the gap between the modern state and traditional society, between institutional design and practice and between “a ‘Western’ framework of authority and Islamic norms and practices”. He sees conflict as both disruptive and constructive of the social and political order.\nThe book draws on sociological perspectives and political science literature to argue that all politics is about conflict. This, he writes, challenges managers of the state. How they deal with contentious issues determines the country’s evolution. Discussing what he calls the “persistent and devastating” clash between two elite groups in Pakistan, the state elite and the political elite, he argues that these groups rest mainly on two power centres, the middle class and political class respectively. “The former is generally identified with the ‘establishment’, led by the army. The latter represents political parties and parliament, which draw on the constitutional edifice as the supreme source of legitimacy.”\nGovernance failures and the ruling elite’s resistance to reform have marked Pakistan’s political history.\nThis state of play, he writes, has led to a “bifocal nature of state authority”. The two represent opposing outlooks, visions, worldviews and policy orientations. “The middle-class narrative focuses on the national interest, but the political class’s idiom focuses on the public interest.” These two power centres define what Waseem calls the “mega conflict between the civil and military organs of state”. He offers an in-depth account of how political initiative has shifted between the state elite representing the middle class and the political class symbolised by leaders of political parties that engage in mass mobilisation through electoral activism.\nWaseem argues that over the decades the establishment has tried to promote, support and impose its “preferred leadership” through the electoral process denuding the country of genuine public representatives. He sees a long history of manipulation of elections by extra-parliamentary forces to shape outcomes and says “the establishment’s preference for client parties contributed enormously to a weak and vulnerable party system in Pakistan”. He backs this up by naming numerous parties the establishment created and then supported.\nRead:If establishment stays neutral, Imran can’t survive no-trust move: Bilawal\nIn a chapter titled ‘An Establishmentarian Democracy’ he deals with an issue as relevant today as in the past as it is among the country’s enduring fault lines. Asserting that democracy has been a major source of conflict he examines whether Pakistan’s present hybrid regime is democratic only in form and not substance. To support his claim that Pakistan is what he calls an ‘establishmentarian democracy’ Waseem first compares its experience to India’s and then seeks to show that the establishment was able to significantly shape the contours of democracy while the weak role of parliament contributed to this. Some may find this an overly cynical and sweeping view that accords the establishment more controlling power over the political system than is merited. But few would disagree with Waseem’s central proposition that the military’s dominant role “hampered the growth of democracy” or that civil-military conflict has been a constant theme. He acknowledges that “while the constitutional tradition has been too weak to stop military takeovers, it has been too strong to allow generals to rule in their own name for long”.\nThe book explores many other themes that have been recurrent in Pakistan’s political history including challenges of the federal project, sub-nationalist movements and Islamisation. There is an interesting analysis of partition in terms of two competing paradigms, one faith-based and the other resting on a shared past. It also delves into why conspiracy theories are embedded in the mindset of educated Pakistanis. Whether the left or right, ‘liberal’ or religious ‘thinking minds’, Waseem sees them all “display paranoia about international conspiracies to pressure, bully, corner or undo Pakistan”.\nThe book has a sweeping scope in examining the many facets of Pakistan’s story. But it would also have benefited from consideration of the country’s economic experience as that is inextricably linked to politics. After all, competition over scarce resources also shaped politics, influenced civil-military relations and fuelled centre-province tensions. A recurrent theme in Pakistan’s history, since at least the 1980s, has been the threat posed to financial and political stability by the budgetary resource crisis. An oligarchic elite relied on ‘borrowed’ growth and bailouts to address the country’s chronic financial crises and resisted meaningful reform that included taxing itself and its support base. The power elite also assumed ‘rentier’ characteristics: using political office to access state resources and thus acquire wealth and unearned income.\nThe enigma of successive civilian and military governments living beyond their means can only be explained in terms of a privilegentsia averse to measures that would either have eroded its position or threatened its interests. This has contributed to miring Pakistan in perpetual financial crisis with virtually every government in the past four decades leaving the economy in much worse shape for its successor."}]}

Prime Minister Imran Khan’s speech at apublic rally in Mailsiand subsequent remarks certainly suggest this. At the rally a week ago, he accused the EU of trying to pressurise him on the Ukraine crisis and asked whether the EU thought Pakistan was its slave. He also repeated, for the umpteenth time, that he had opposed America’s war on terror and asked whether Nato had ever thanked Pakistan for its role in that war. Criticism of the US wasn’t exactly ‘breaking news’ as the PM has frequently assailed Washington for its military intervention in Afghanistan. But his wider attack on the West struck an angry and belligerent note.\nThis was classic populist rhetoric and campaign oratory aimed to galvanise his support base. But it also played on a theme that his ministers and media apologists are now regularly churning out — of a leader heroically standing up to the West. In fact, his increasing criticism of the West has come in the backdrop of growing political pressure on him from the opposition’sno-confidence move. The more this pressure has mounted and public discontent intensified over inflation, the greater the ruling party’s resort to disingenuous narratives about an international conspiracy. The PM himself was reported as saying that “multiple foreign hands” were behind the opposition’s campaign to oust him. A government spokesman repeatedly tweeted that the no-confidence move was being hatched by “international powers” with the opposition merely acting as hired “brokers”. Other ministers echoed this. The education minister tweeted a cartoon portraying Western support for opposition leaders.\nRead more:Writing’s on the wall, PM Imran's time is up\nAre these conspiracy theories setting up an alibi to project the prime minister as a martyr if he loses power? Is this an effort to find external scapegoats for domestic trouble? It certainly seems that way. But other aspects of the PM’s utterances and his government’s statements also merit consideration. Since hisMoscow tripand meeting with President Vladimir Putin the day Russia invaded Ukraine, the government has sought to blunt criticism of the visit’s timing by casting this as an effort to stake out an ‘independent’ foreign policy. This ostensible ‘independent’ policy prevented the government from taking a principled stand on the invasion of a sovereign state that clearly violated international law. Officials claimed Pakistan was neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but anodyne statements by the foreign ministry fuelled an impression of a soft stance towards Moscow. For example, official statements called on both sides of the conflict to “de-escalate”, raising the question of how a country that had been invaded was expected to de-escalate.\nForeign policy is falling victim to political confrontation and populist rhetoric.\nWhy did the PM lash out at EU countries and was it wise to do so? The Islamabad-based envoys of 22 mostly European countries, but including others, issued a joint press release urging Pakistan to back the UN General Assembly resolution andcondemn Russia’s actionsin Ukraine. This public appeal was certainly unusual for which the foreign ministry privately and publicly admonished the envoys calling their action “unacceptable” and “contrary to diplomatic norms.” The matter should have ended there — both sides having had their say and disagreed. Instead, the PM chose to publicly slam these countries.\nCalling out the West for their double standards and hypocrisy is of course hugely popular with the public but it does not behoove the prime minister to engage in this. Western countries have much to answer for as many have acted unilaterally on several occasions, intervened militarily in other countries and shown disregard for international norms and law. But that doesn’t make the Russian action beyond criticism. Two wrongs don’t make a right. In any case interstate relations should be handled strategically, not emotionally by those in power. Disagreement is one thing, but mounting the hustings and pouring scorn at countries that are Pakistan’s important trade and development partners does little to advance the country’s interests.\nBeyond this avoidable diplomatic spat what is hard to comprehend is the unnecessary length to which the government has gone to avoid taking a clear position on Ukraine’s crisis as if Islamabad’s relations with Russia trumps all its other interests. It was crucial after the Moscow visit and Russia’s invasion to balance between a new-found but as yet undefined relationship with Russia and Western countries that have long-standing, substantive ties with Pakistan. Foreign policy after all is about deftly balancing interests to enlarge options not narrow them, and that too for the sake of a relationship with no strategic content and whose destination remains unclear.\nEditorial:Pakistan's near absence from the global stage in the midst of the Ukraine crisis is jarring\nSome might argue that the government’s stance has as much to do with its disappointment with the US and the scant attention it has received from the Biden administration than with any significant stake in ties with Russia. In other words, past grievances with the West and a jilted lover syndrome with the US may have been a factor for its stance rather than any grand strategy. This of course is arguable. But if true, it would mean subordinating the country’s foreign policy to injured ego and not basing it on a rational calculation of interests. Grievances shouldn’t determine policy, only the country’s interests should.\nMeanwhile, the claim pressed by the PM and his ministers that Pakistan’s foreign policy has acquired ‘independence’ on his watch also bears scrutiny. No one has explained what this means other than serving as a slogan or gimmick for a beleaguered government. A single visit to Moscow is hardly evidence of an independent foreign policy. In fact, foreign policy under Khan has been marked by continuity, not departures from the past. Moreover, an independent foreign policy has to rest on the country’s economic independence and inherent economic strength. Chronic dependence on bailouts, loans and economic largesse from abroad for which governments have to seek perpetual help from other countries is hardly consistent with an independent foreign policy. Thus, the government’s claim of an independent foreign policy is just as hollow as it’s cry of ‘conspiracy’."}]}

Most are interconnected and have been feeding off and reinforcing each other in an unbroken cycle.\nThey include the structural crisis of the economy, erosion of the state’s institutional capacity, the education deficit, uncontrolled population growth, environmental degradation and, of course, growing intolerance in society. Security challenges also endure with an unstable Afghanistan on the western frontier and a hostile India on the country’s eastern flank.\nLeaders should go beyond cheering tanks and planes to implement our founding fathers’ vision.\nWhatever the outcome of the ongoing political battle between the government and opposition, it is whether key domestic problems are seriously tackled that will shape the country’s future. None is more consequential than the economic challenge. The sharp increase in financing gaps in the government’s budget and the country’s trade account as well as rising debt are all a consequence of the country living beyond its means. Inflation has soared, foreign exchange reserves have depleted, pressure mounted on the rupee, and business confidence has eroded. Pakistan urgently needs funds to avert a financial crisis. That’s in the short term and essentially a band-aid response.\nRed Zone Files:All set for a collision course\nTo put the economy on a viable and sustainable footing, steps are needed to deal with the structural sources of chronic budget and balance-of-payments deficits. That requires political consensus on key measures — an economic compact as it were. For this, agreement is necessary among ALL political parties and other stakeholders. What would constitute the fundamental elements of this economic compact? Tax reform should be the top priority to make the system simple and equitable. This should be implemented nationally so that a single tax regime prevails in the country. Serious mobilisation of domestic resources should involve widening the tax base, ensuring compliance, reforming GST and ending exemptions. This, along with reconfiguring budget priorities, imposing spending restraints and cutting subsidies, would constitute the single most important effort to set the economy on a path to sustainability.\nAnother element in the economic compact should be agreement on a single and liberal business regulatory framework for the country. Consistency is essential to maintain that framework as well as under-implementation projects when governments change. Policy continuity and certainty is the key to building investor confidence. A third area on which agreement is essential is identifying loss-making, bankrupt state-owned enterprises to be privatised. These financially draining SOEs have long been bleeding into budget deficits and adding to the country’s debt — a burden that needs to end once and for all.\nThere are other core areas that also need to figure in the compact and taken out of partisan politics, such as power sector reform, State Bank’s operational autonomy, market determination of the exchange rate and steps to expand the export base. Again, it will take leadership that thinks long term to forge this compact and determine what reforms can secure consensus. Efforts to achieve such consensus should rest on the acknowledgement that unless the economy is fixed, all else is in vain.\nThe same argument holds for the education challenge and the need for a long view. Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah once said, “Education is a matter of life and death for our country.” Yet his advice was never followed. Pakistan still has the world’s second-highest number of out-of-school children — 22 million. The country has always underspent on education. Yet no single issue is certain to transform the country’s destiny than investment in education. This is the key to economic progress and global competitiveness and to countering extremism and promoting a more tolerant society. Although education is a provincial subject, the federal government should take the lead to forge agreement on prioritising education reform and encouraging the provinces to allocate more funds aimed at enhancing both the coverage and quality of education. Education for all should be seen as a strategic imperative, not just a desirable social goal.\nAnother compelling area for policy action that rarely figures in official priorities or political debate is the country’s rising population, still the fastest growing in South Asia (other than Afghanistan). This has far-reaching economic and social consequences and security implications, especially as there is an absence of planning for the growing number of people. Unless population management steps are nationally implemented, a demographic disaster looms if educational opportunities and jobs do not keep pace with the unbridled growth in numbers.\nRead more:Population and security\nInstitutional reform too is an imperative on which the country’s political leadership needs to take a long view. It is widely agreed that the state’s institutional capacity has weakened over time. Unless the instruments of governance are made fit for purpose to meet the requirements of modern governance and improve service delivery, the most well-conceived government policy cannot be effectively implemented. This requires comprehensive reform, not just piecemeal tinkering. There are plenty of good recommendations in reports by successive official commissions to draw on. The key elements of reform are in any case well known.\nThis is not an exhaustive list of issues that need to be addressed, but they are the most consequential and merit the attention of political leaders if they are to shape a hopeful future for the country. The spirit of March 1940 ought to go beyond cheering tanks and planes to inspire an effort to reimagine Pakistan according to the vision of our founding fathers."}]}

In the face of this challenge, the government’s response seems to have lurched between delay, legal moves, public rallies and volleys of abuse directed at opposition leaders. What’s more, a disingenuous message is being disseminated that the opposition’s no-confidence move is theproduct of an international conspiracy. This response shows a curious lack of understanding that the challenge is political and needs a political response. It also suggests that PTI leaders are still struggling to evolve a coherent political strategy to counter the opposition’s offensive.\nInitially, it seemed the government didn’t take the opposition’s plan, unity or resolve seriously, deriding its leaders and declaring that their designs would never succeed. When it dawned that this was emerging as the most significant threat to his government in its fourth year in power, the prime minister reached out belatedly and half-heartedly to allies of his fragile coalition but offered little assurance that their grievances would be addressed. What shook the government was when cracks in the ruling party exploded in public withdissident after dissident surfacingto express misgivings with the prime minister’s governance. The number of party rebels swelled beyond the long-estranged members of the Jahangir Khan Tareen group.\nWhichever way the vote goes a period of political volatility and instability lies ahead.\nThe ruling party’s panicky response involved egging on activists to take disruptive actions, includingstorming Sindh House, and hurling invective against dissidents with ministers indulging in name-calling. As the danger of a wider party rebellion grew, the government narrative began to change and entailed calls on dissidents to return to the fold with an ‘all-will-be-forgiven’ message. But the prime minister then shifted course saying he would rather lose office than engage in horse-trading. He characterised the battle with the opposition as one between good and evil, invoking religion to reinforce this, but betraying nervousness in casting those who chose to be neutral as “animals”. It was accompanied by the warning that party rebels would face the wrath of the people.\nEditorial:PM Imran's speech indicates he has come to terms with the likely outcome of the no-trust move\nThis response did little to instill confidence in the ranks of the government or strengthen its position. Nor did angry and rambling speeches by its leaders, attacks on the media and press conferences by ministers known for making scurrilous remarks. In a nationwide public appeal, Khan called for a “historic” party rally in a “show of power” against those he dubbed as a “gang of thieves”. Without amplifying, he said the opposition is in for a rude shock on voting day. PTI trolls went into hyperdrive on social media lashing out at anyone who suggested the government could be ousted. Some obliquely criticised the establishment for being ‘neutral’ in the political battle. Orchestrating demonstrations by activists outside the homes of dissidents showed the ruling party’s desperation and resort to Trumpian-style intimidatory tactics.\nDelay became another tactic used by the government with the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers’ meeting being a convenient pretext to call the National Assembly session on March 25 — later than March 21, when the constitutionally prescribed 14-day period ended to convene a requisitioned meeting for a no-confidence vote. Even then, the motion wasnot allowed to be moved on that day. It is now scheduled for March 28. This cast the Speaker of the Assembly in an intensely partisan light with Asad Qaiser becoming the centre of controversy and the opposition accusing him of violating the Constitution.\nIn facing the most serious test of his tenure, Khan’s political skills, and those of his inner circle, have been found wanting. Rather than focus on the Assembly and mobilise support there to defeat the no-confidence motion by political means, the governmentfiled a referenceasking the Supreme Court for an advisory opinion on the Constitution’s Article 63-A. This so-called defection clause prescribes action against lawmakers who vote across party lines. The government argued that this should involve pre-emptive action against members to de-seat them, invalidate their vote and disqualify them for life. This effort to meet a political challenge by taking the matter out of parliament suggested the government’s lack of confidence in its majority. Resorting to the Supreme Court on a political issue followed a well-trodden path but didn’t detract from the fact that such matters are best resolved by political leaders and lawmakers themselves.\nAn influential voice of disagreement with the government’s interpretation came from the Supreme Court Bar Association. In its written submission to the court, it stated that the vote in the Assembly is an individual right and all members of the National Assembly enjoyed this right to be exercised freely as provided by the Constitution. It also said Article 63-A does not allow pre-emptive action against an MNA.\nIn the parliamentary showdown ahead, much hinges on the position the three coalition partners of the government take. Between them PML-Q, MQM and Balochistan Awami Party have 17 votes, enough to turn the tables on Khan if they decide to support the opposition’s move. This would also weaken the government’s narrative that money was used to buy the loyalties of party dissidents in horse-trading by the opposition. For their part, the allies seem to be bargaining hard with both sides while publicly voicing their grievances with the government for long ignoring their demands.\nAlthough the odds seem stacked against the government, the vote could still go either way. It would be hazardous to predict the outcome of a vote still days away. What is certain is that delay has not helped to calm a politically charged situation made more volatile by rival rallies organised by both the government and opposition. There is much speculation about the “massive surprise” the prime minister promises to spring to turn the situation decisively in his favour. But whoever succeeds in the no-confidence vote a period of instability, even turbulence, lies ahead as the unfortunate political tradition in Pakistan is of losers rarely accepting defeat quietly or gracefully."}]}

Although that parliamentary process was subverted and a constitutional crisis ensued it will still mark an end to his rule. Few governments in Pakistan’s recent history began their term with Khan’s advantages. He had unqualified support from the military, widespread public goodwill, control of Punjab, a divided and demoralised opposition and a popular yearning for change. But few governments so quickly underwhelmed its supporters and disappointed others by its underperformance, unkept promises, polarising politics and Trumpian conduct.\nA combination of factors may explain why Khan’s government faced a crisis of confidence that eventually cut short its term. The first undoubtedly was the pretence by a minority government that it had a decisive mandate and could rule unilaterally, riding roughshod over the views and interests of other political actors. Heading a coalition government should have involved humility and efforts at consensus building, compromise and listening to allies. Instead, Imran Khan chose to govern without consensus, ignoring Pakistan’s federal reality and a parliamentary system that needs give and take to make it work.\nRead:Imran Khan’s latest move is a further demonstration of his contempt for parliament and the democratic process\nThis was compounded by the intensely personalised nature of governance in which power was concentrated in one person, who took key decisions on his own rather than on the basis of well-considered advice. Personalised governance meant reliance on the instincts and ego of the leader rather than an institutional process of policy advice. This led to repeated, embarrassing policy U-turns and fed the image of a whimsical government muddling through, with little sense of direction. Some of this could be attributed to Khan’s inexperience and unfamiliarity with statecraft. But even in his fourth year his non-consultative and arrogant style persisted which blindsided him to rising public disillusionment with his performance and disenchantment in his own party.\nHubris, erratic governance, intolerance of opposition and polarising politics marked PTI’s rule.\nA third factor was the weak leadership Khan selected to run Punjab despite his own party’s misgivings. This became his government’s Achilles heel. Its poor performance produced growing internal party discord and contributed significantly to PTI losing political ground in the province and to the rising number of dissidents who were to become politically consequential to the opposition’s no-confidence move. Lack of governance at the centre also contributed to political setbacks for the ruling party in successive by-elections. But rather than examine the reasons for defeats suffered in elections for national seats and in local polls the prime minister spent more time delivering morality lectures and religious sermons.\nThe party was left disorganised, factionalised and ill-disciplined. Political management remained a skill unlearnt by the top leadership not least because it relied on the establishment to mobilise majorities to pass legislation in parliament and keep coalition allies in line. But there were limits to this. Khan’s refusal to find time, much less respond to the needs of allies alienated them and exacted a political price. Several abandoned him to join the opposition in the move to oust Khan.\nAbove all, Khan’s obsessive preoccupation with demonising the opposition and attacking its leaders monopolised much of his time and energy. NAB cases against opposition figures were expected to destroy their reputation and political standing but the one-sided nature of accountability and lack of court convictions left the process in disrepute. Unable to accept opposition as legitimate activity he and his ministers constantly portrayed its leaders as venal and unpatriotic, painting all of them with the same brush. This translated into a refusal to work with other parliamentary parties. It united a disparate group of opposition parties, with divergent interests, fired by the resolve to oust him by constitutional means. Pushing the major opposition parties to the wall ultimately produced a joint front and left the ruling party with few allies in parliament.\nThe government’s overwhelming focus on its so-called accountability drive to undermine rivals proved a fatal distraction from improving its performance especially as deteriorating economic conditions became the source of rising public discontent. It meant lack of attention to issues that mattered most to people — cost of living, unemployment, increase in utility charges, and uninterrupted supply of essential commodities and services. In fact, the Khan government’s economic management was marked by U-turns and frequent changes of ministers and financial advisers. Its revolving door approach was also evident in other areas but had more serious implications for the economy. Despite a modest recovery following the government’s Covid-related stimulus measures, the strategic mistake it made was to delay resuming the IMF programme. This depleted foreign exchange reserves, put pressure on the rupee and eroded market confidence. Inflation became a politically explosive issue, rising significantly for a combination of reasons, including supply side and monetary factors, while unrestrained subsidy schemes and Khan’s ‘give-away’ populist schemes also contributed. Both internal and external debt rose exponentially with public debt spiking to over 90 per cent of GDP.\nSkyrocketing inflation emerged as the single most important reason for growing public disaffection with the PTI government. This state of economic distress and hardship provided an enabling environment for the opposition to step up its campaign and leverage public discontent to mount the no-confidence challenge. For PML-N it opened an opportunity to attract dissidents from PTI who felt their party would be an electoral liability in elections and sought arrangements with the party they saw as dominating Punjab. In this challenging environment, the PTI leadership squandered many opportunities to repurpose its government and refurbish its fading image.\nNo account of what went wrong would be complete without mentioning the civil-military relationship. Relations became uneasy last year over theappointmentof the new ISI chief and disagreements over governance and foreign policy issues. But there is little to suggest any rupture or that the establishment withdrew its support from the government. The military establishment did, however, adopt a posture of neutrality in the no-confidence process and, in a departure from the past, refrained from pulling out the government’s political chestnuts from the fire. Whether this was a key factor in the opposition’s ability to mobilise the required parliamentary number is open to question. What is certain is that the reasons for the Khan government’s denouement were its own hubris, erratic governance, intolerance of opposition, confrontational politics and policy missteps."}]}

In the end, he earned the dubious distinction of being the country’s first prime minister to beousted by a vote of no-confidence.\nBut not before the Supreme Court was forced to step in to resolve the constitutional crisis that raged for several days. The Supreme Courtverdictmarked a win for constitutional supremacy, the rule of law and democracy, all of which were imperiled by Khan’s actions to prevent a parliamentary vote of no-confidence against him.\nIn a historic judgement, the Supreme Court declared the deputy speaker’s ruling unconstitutional by which he hadarbitrarily blockedthe no-confidence vote on April 3 on the fabricated grounds of a ‘foreign conspiracy’ aimed at ousting the government. It also quashed subsequent actions for being contrary to the Constitution. Its unanimous judgement restored the National Assembly, illegallydissolvedby President Arif Alvi on Khan’s advice, and ordered the no-confidence vote to proceed uninterrupted. But the court’s effort to resolve the crisis did not see Khan and his coterie of ministers graciously accept and comply with the verdict.\nRead:Who defends the Constitution?\nRevived by the Supreme Court, the Assembly convened on April 9 when no-confidence proceedings finally got underway. But all day the Speaker kept stonewalling the vote, adjourning the session every few hours and giving the floor to the treasury benches to filibuster the proceedings including a long-winded, disingenuous speech by Shah Mahmood Qureshi. This turned the session into a virtual farce. After several suspenseful and tense hours amid indications that the government did not intend to call the vote, the move by Supreme Court judges to convene at midnight proved to be decisive. With the possibility of contempt of court proceedings looming against the speaker for defying the verdict, Asad Qaiser resigned. This enabled the Assembly to proceed at midnight to vote Khan out of office and bring his rule to an inglorious end.\nAlthough Khan’s exit from power has opened a new, uncertain phase in Pakistan’s politics, it is important to examine the past week’s tumultuous events and the many dimensions of the political and constitutional crisis that shook — and exhausted — the country. The former ruling party’s undemocratic attitude and conduct plunged Pakistan into uncharted territory. The unprecedented crisis came to encompass all the country’s institutions — the Supreme Court, parliament, presidency, Punjab Assembly, the Election Commission and last but not least, the establishment, despite its intent to stay away from the political turmoil. It was, after all, a top establishment official who reportedly approached opposition leaders on behalf of the embattled premier to ask (before April 3) if they would withdraw the no-confidence move in return for Khan’s resignation and dissolution of assemblies — to give him a ‘face saver’. The opposition refused.\nThe unprecedented crisis Khan created came to encompass all the country’s institutions.\nSeveral aspects of the crisis that followed, distinguished it from others in the country’s chequered past and hold lessons for the future. Never before did a government faced with defeat in a no-confidence vote seek to circumvent the process by patently unconstitutional manoeuvres, political chicanery and delays. Twice in the past, in 1989 and 2006, governments confronted no-confidence moves, but they faced up to them in parliament and defeated them. In 1989, lawmakers were taken to ‘safe places’ by the opposition to make them inaccessible but that did not urge the late Benazir Bhutto to block the vote, which she won. Also unprecedented was the PTI government’s refusal to relinquish power even though it knew it had lost its parliamentary majority. It got a partisan president to ask Khan to continue as prime minister even after he had dissolved the Assembly. Resorting to Trumpian tactics, Khan called on his supporters to hold demonstrations in an effort to intimidate rivals and influence the Supreme Court and later to express displeasure with the verdict and his ouster.\nEditorial:To fuel his political narrative, Imran Khan has done grievous damage to Pakistan’s diplomacy and diplomats\nAnother difference from past crises is the way the government used the alibi of a US-orchestrated plot to explain — and deny — the loss of its parliamentary majority. Khan and his loyalists went on long rants about this conspiracy, misusing a diplomatic cable to make the claim — as if anyone conspiring would convey this to an envoy! In a series of leaks and background briefings the establishment indicated this was totally false. As did the majority of people. A Gallup survey released last week found almost two-thirds of people did not support the government’s conspiracy claim. None of this, however, deterred Khan from reiterating the conspiracy narrative in his last speech as prime minister and then in the April 9 Assembly session by his overzealous ministers.\nThird, the government repeated its defiance and violation of the Constitution and parliamentary rules in Punjab too, where it engaged in a succession of reckless manoeuvres. It kept postponing the provincial assembly session to prevent the vote to elect a new leader after Khan’s chief minister, Usman Buzdar, was asked to step down. When PTI found its nominee for chief minister, Parvez Elahi didn’t command the required numbers, itprevented the assembly from meeting, even locking the chamber, reinforcing it with barbed wire and shutting out the deputy speaker, the custodian of the House. These were scenes never witnessed before. Some commentators described the conduct worse than of military dictators in the past.\nFour, the meltdown of the former ruling party was also a significant departure from the past. Both at the centre and in Punjab, groups of dissidents emerged and announced their disassociation with a government that had lost its way, in their view. The way PTI’s parliamentary membership began to unravel has few parallels if any in Pakistan’s history. This erosion, due principally to its leadership’s arrogant and blundering ways, is still underway, and raises questions about the party’s electoral future. The move by the leadership to disqualify 20 of its MNAs exposed the extent of revolt in the party. Its fragmentation also reflects the fact that the party has been more a collection of cult followers or a fan club than a proper organisation. Many so-called electables were in any case injected into the party by the establishment and who therefore owe no loyalty to Khan.\nWhile the transition ahead is expected to be relatively smooth, there is much uncertainty about what will follow once a new government is installed. But for now, democracy has been strengthened while the Supreme Court’s judgement has established there will be swift retribution for constitutional transgressions and that no one is above the law. Hopefully, this will close the door to future constitutional violations, strengthen the rule of law and finally bury the doctrine of necessity."}]}

The political polarisation in evidence today has few parallels in Pakistan’s recent history, with the social media amplifying the divide and giving it an inflammatory edge.\nIn this politically charged environment in which an angry party is unreconciled to its loss of power, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has a sea of challenges to navigate before he can take the country to safer shores. Calling for unity, consensus and the need to heal the nation in hisfirst parliamentary addressas premier he struck the right note. But this may be easier said than done. His efforts to establish political and economic stability face imposing obstacles.\nFor a start, managing an unwieldy coalition of disparate parties, which will be rivals in the next election, will consume much of his time and energy. After all, the government’s parliamentary majority is precariously narrow. He hopes that sharing cabinet portfolios with coalition partners will give them a stake in the survival of the government. But it will also mean forging agreement among them on policy measures. Meeting their demands while taking timely decisions by consensus will involve a delicate balancing act for a prime minister serving at the federal level for the first time in his otherwise long political career.\nThe coalition has an incentive to stick together in the face of the common challenge from a belligerent Imran Khan. Even so, they have differing views on key policy areas and will adopt positions with an eye on elections. For now, there is agreement that the government and assemblies should serve out the rest of their term of a year and a half until general elections are called. How politically feasible this turns out to be is open to question.\nSharif’s greatest challenge and top priority is to stabilise a deeply ailing economy. Pakistan’s chronic fiscal and balance of payments deficits are at a record high, foreign exchange reserves have depleted, the rupee is under pressure, inflation has soared and debt risen exponentially. The energy crisis is also set to worsen this summer.\nA spokesman of the new governmentclaimsthat financing needs next year are estimated to be around $30 billion while the current account deficit in the ongoing fiscal year is about $20bn. Pakistan’s financing requirements this fiscal year are about $9bn, $6bn for the current account gap and $3bn for debt repayments.\nSome may deem these numbers as overestimates. But financing needs are large and urgent, and with reserves precariously low it is necessary to restart talks with the IMF to continue the loan programme. Without a Fund programme, Pakistan will be unable to access financing from the World Bank, other multilateral agencies and even bilateral partners including China.\nEditorial:New PM’s challenge\nThis confronts the government with tough choices. While resuming the IMF programme is essential it will have to reckon with taking politically unpopular steps, especially at a time when inflation is hitting people hard and was the major factor for public discontent with the previous government.\nThe government’s dilemma could be mitigated to some extent if it is able to persuade the Fund to soften its conditionalities in the multiyear programme given that it will be a short-lived government with elections ahead. Even then, the government would have to manage the political fallout of measures it may still have to take.\nThe ruling coalition faces daunting economic and political challenges in a deeply divided country.\nThe political challenge is no less daunting. Imran Khan is set on a course to mount maximum pressure on the government through confrontational politics and demonstrations of popular power. He hasannounced public ralliesacross the country which are likely to be big draws as that inPeshawarlast week.\nHis aim is to force the Sharif government to call early elections. He is encouraged by the response he has received from supporters to believe elections would return him to power. He may be mistaken in assuming large crowds automatically translate into votes, but for now he is determined to play a spoiler’s role and try to make the new government dysfunctional.\nHowever, his decision for PTI lawmakers totender mass resignations— to disrupt the political system — may hurt his party, which is why many opposed it. Not only does it leave the parliamentary field open to treasury benches to do as they will, but it may also weaken their MNAs’ prospects in electoral contests that lie ahead. Nevertheless, the Sharif government will face a formidable foe in Khan and efforts to establish political stability will confront constant hurdles from PTI’s agitational activities.\nKhan will continue to fuel thenarrative of a foreign conspiracythat unseated him and seek to tap into anti-American sentiment. Despite the fact that the DG, ISPR has clearly debunked the conspiracy claim, Khan’s allegation has traction among his loyal base and even beyond in a conspiracy theory-ridden society. It is therefore imperative for the government to counter this by unequivocally proving it to be false.\nSharif’s plan to call a meeting of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security to examine this, with service chiefs in attendance, is a step in the right direction. But it needs to happen sooner rather than later.\nThis will enable his government to press ahead more confidently to mend relations with the US and the rest of the West. The priority in the relatively short life of the government, however, will be to fortify ties with Pakistan’s two strategic allies, China and Saudi Arabia. That should be easy as Sharif has worked with the Chinese on several projects in the past and the Sharifs have long-standing relations with the Saudi royal family. The prime minister’s early meetings and statements have reinforced this priority as also the desire to strengthen ties with the US, EU and UK. But first order issues are expected to all be domestic. Thus, major foreign policy initiatives, including with India, will likely wait until after elections.\nCritical tests lie ahead for the ruling coalition. It has to show it can stay together and govern, manage a troubled economy, dispel scepticism about ‘Purana’ Pakistan and meet the expectations of the public who yearn for stability and effective governance."}]}

His extra-parliamentary campaign to take to the streets and hold public rallies seeks to mount pressure on the government until it relents or the establishment intervenes.

But it is unlikely to deter Khan from pressing this narrative. He is following a Trumpian playbook to whip up emotions among supporters who seem ready to buy his claim.

He and his party have also mainstreamed incivility both in their political rhetoric and conduct in pursuit of their objectives.

An important way is to clearly state its purpose in office, otherwise it will be seen as an arrangement whose only aim was to oust Khan. Because of the government’s short lifespan, it may only be able to deal with the urgent and not the important. But it can still offer a road map of what it hopes to accomplish in the months ahead, even if it is unable to finish work on these goals. It can distinguish itself from the previous government and also dispel scepticism about it by delivering competent governance.\nAlthough the cabinet is a motley group, several ministers bring experience and a reputation of being capable. The prime minister himself has long been known as a ‘doer’ who knows how to get things done and moves with speed in ensuring the bureaucracy delivers.\nThe Sharif government should avoid mimicking PTI in expending its energy on assailing political opponents. Responding to Khan’s allegations and moves is one thing but obsessing about them will only distract it from the task of governing. Government leaders have repeatedly said that there will be no political vendettas or persecution of opponents but they must act on this. It would be tempting to put Khan under pressure to counter the challenge he poses but this would be counterproductive. It should be resisted for the country to break from the unseemly tradition of framing politically motivated cases against rivals.\nRead:PML-N’s challenge begins\nThe economy will be the make-or-break issue for the government. The situation is dire, which has urged Sharif to seek a swift resumption of the IMF programme as a top priority. The newly appointed finance minister isalready in Washingtonhoping to quickly finalise a deal. This is necessary but not sufficient.\nOf course, the first order of business is to stabilise the fragile macroeconomic situation, curb expenditure and secure funds to finance the record current account deficit and meet debt repayments. The greatest challenge is to curtail soaring inflation and not resort to more inflationary borrowing. Sharif has an opportunity in his initial days to show he can make more than a band-aid effort by measures that are a structural break from the past. These could include harmonising the convoluted sales tax structure, introducing a uniform system of import duties and cutting subsidies to loss-making state-owned enterprises.\nThe announcement of structural reforms to establish financial viability will show Sharif means business and can take tough decisions in the country’s interest. If he can get his coalition partners to agree on a reform package that would help to define the government’s purpose in power.\nSharif has already told the cabinet in its first meeting that economic stability, not politics, should be the priority and solutions must be found to the country’s energy crisis, rising debt and other pressing economic problems.\nImposing challenges lie ahead in a deeply polarised country. The democratic system itself is imperilled by the disruptive tactics of the former ruling party, unwilling to accept its ouster from power. Imran Khan has alsothreatened a marchon Islamabad in his campaign against the government. For the coalition trying to govern in this fraught political environment there are formidable hurdles to overcome. But all political players should recognise that if the economy tanks all else will be in vain."}]}

In a polarised environment, it is important to consider some facts to set the record straight.\nThe historical record testifies that over the decades, successive governments acted to protect Pakistan’s core interests and defied external pressure to adopt policies contrary to our national interests. Continuity and consistency have been the hallmark of the country’s foreign policy through civilian and military governments alike.\nRead:Non-intervention and the law\nThe most outstanding example of ‘independence’ in Pakistan’s foreign policy is how the country acquired a nuclear capability in the face of Western opposition and unprecedented pressure. It saw the strategic imperative of possessing a nuclear deterrent once India detonated a nuclear device in 1974. This despite Western efforts to stop Pakistan after India’s nuclear explosion. The aim, given its conventional asymmetry with a hostile India, was to restore strategic equilibrium by securing the means to deter aggression. The traumatic experience of the breakup of Pakistan in 1971 had taught the lesson that the country could depend only on itself for its security.\nThe quest for a nuclear capability was encapsulated in Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s much cited remark that if India built the bomb, “we will eat grass, even go hungry, but we will get one of our own”. It was a challenging journey with innumerable obstacles along the way. The objective could not have been achieved if successive governments comprising different political parties had not ALL pursued this regardless of the costs.\nOver several decades, strenuous efforts were undertaken to develop a strategic capability and an operational deterrent with a credible delivery system.\nPakistan was a close ally of the US in the 1980s, the decade when the nuclear programme was at a critical stage. It was working with Washington in the joint struggle to roll back the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. In 1990, the US invoked the infamous Pressler Amendment to impose unilateral sanctions on Pakistan on the nuclear issue. This was preceded by US warnings that unless Pakistan changed course, military and economic sanctions would follow. Pakistan resisted the pressure and protested against the discriminatory US policy. It braved sanctions, censure and technology denial — and an unfair embargo on military equipment and aircraft it had paid for — because its national security was paramount and non-negotiable. From being America’s ‘most allied ally’, Pakistan became its ‘most sanctioned friend’. The more pressure mounted on Islamabad, the greater was the determination to stay firm and accelerate the programme. No government caved into coercive pressure — an unequivocal display of ‘independence’ in our foreign policy.\nSuccessive governments defied external pressure to protect Pakistan’s core interests.\nPressure from the West continued. Pakistan was asked to sign the CTBT, agree to a one-time inspection of nuclear facilities in return for release of its military equipment, sign up for negotiations to proceed in the UN Conference on Disarmament for a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty and curb its missile development. As I was closely involved in talks on these issues, serving twice as Pakistan’s ambassador to the US, I was witness to the number of times Pakistan said no to all of the above to pursue an ‘independent’ policy.\nWhen India conducted nuclear tests in May 1998, the Clinton administration offered incentives (and disincentives) if Pakistan desisted from testing. Prime minister Nawaz Sharif went ahead regardless. Pakistan became a declared nuclear power.\nThe history of this remarkable achievement — involving multiple governments and the pivotal role of the country’s scientists — is narrated by Feroze Khan in his insightful book, Eating Grass. It should be read by those who fallaciously argue that Pakistan’s foreign policy has never been independent.\nThose unacquainted with history would find another example instructive. This concerns Pakistan’s evolving ties with China during the Cold War. Pakistan was then a member of Western military alliances, Seato and Cento; it had also signed a defence agreement with Washington in 1959. But none of this prevented Pakistan from pursuing an independent line to forge relations with Beijing. It was the first Muslim state and among the world’s first countries to recognise PRC. After the 1962 Sino-Indian war, Pakistan significantly strengthened ties with Beijing in the midst of America’s efforts to isolate China.\nAs former foreign secretary Abdul Sattar wrote in his book, US warnings were cast aside that it would review ties with Pakistan if it built relations with China. Declassified documents show such threats were rejected — until 1971, when the US switched course and used Pakistan as a conduit for Henry Kissinger’s historic trip to Beijing, that paved the way for rapprochement with China.\nRecent illustrations of Pakistan standing up to sustained pressure are found in the uneasy Pakistan-US relationship during the 20-year war in Afghanistan, a war Islamabad counselled Washington not to wage in early exchanges following 9/11. Islamabad cautioned the US that a military solution would be elusive. It advised kinetic action against Al Qaeda to be “short and surgical” and to draw a distinction between Al Qaeda and the Taliban so that a diplomatic path could be found to eventually engage the Taliban in talks for a political settlement.\nEditorial:20 years after 9/11\nWashington did not heed this advice (but came to this conclusion almost 20 years later). Even as Pakistan came under pressure to ‘do more’, it never shied away from urging a negotiated end to the war.\nSince Pakistan kept a channel of communication open to the Taliban, which eventually helped to bring them to the negotiating table in Doha, it wasaccusedof playing a ‘double game’. But Islamabad was acting on its own interests as it did not have the luxury of retreating to the other end of the world. Inshutting downthe Nato supply route to Afghanistan in 2011 for seven months to protest against the killing of Pakistani soldiers in a Nato air raid, Pakistan again took a stand on principle.\nExamples abound of how Pakistan adopted an independent line when its interests dictated. Those ignorant of this denigrate the country when they say Pakistan only did what foreign powers wanted. Recalling these examples may sound like a statement of the obvious, but it is necessary when an alternate reality is being created by peddling a narrative based on untruth."}]}

But newer ones have emerged to make the political environment more challenging if not combustible.\nKey among the more long-standing fault lines are ceaseless government-opposition confrontations and the country’s persisting structural economic problems, which the lack of political consensus has left unresolved. These have been consequential for the country and have undermined both the evolution of democracy as well as economic and political stability. They continue to be perpetuated by tediously recurring conduct and policies.\nNew fault lines may resemble long prevailing ones but are distinct in many ways. The most obvious is the political polarisation that today characterises the country. There are few if any precedents of this even though divisive politics is not new. This polarisation has divided people, society and families as never before along intensely partisan lines. The brand of populist politics practised by PTI, with its either-with-us-or-against-us stance, has drawn rigid political battle lines especially with its leaders now casting all its opponents as venal, unpatriotic and pawns of foreign powers. Itsnarrativeof being ousted from office by a foreign conspiracy finds ready believers among its base of angry urban youth who are willing to discard facts. This narrative also helps to delegitimise opponents in the eyes of its followers. The xenophobic nationalism purveyed by its leaders is sowing further division in the country.\nPolarisation and the narrative defining its contours has meant that politics has assumed the form of ferocious political warfare in which opponents have to be eliminated from the political scene in a terminal conflict and not competed with, much less accommodated. This take-no-prisoners approach has erased any middle or meeting ground and ruled out any possibility of bridging the divide. Extreme partisanship is making the working of the political system near impossible.\nTrue that democracies elsewhere are also floundering in the face of intolerant populist forces polarising their societies. But that only testifies to how democratic systems are being challenged because of weak commitment to democratic norms by demagogues, rising intolerance and lack of restraint in politics. In fact, democracy is rendered dysfunctional when denuded of the essential ingredients to make it work — tolerance, consensus and accommodating the interests and views of ‘others’. The danger Pakistan faces today is of democratic backsliding.\nAn aspect of the country’s polarised politics is how this has injected a toxic quality into political conversation and debased what passes for debate. The language and political narratives deployed by party leaders increasingly flout the basic norms of civility.\nPolitics has, of course, never been polite in Pakistan. The 1990s, for example, saw a good deal of political name-calling, character assassination, and accusations of disloyalty to the country, with top leaders frequently dubbed as ‘security risks’. But the political culture today has sunk to even lower depths of incivility.\nProvocative rhetoric and statements that routinely fail the truth test are made with abandon and with no regard for the consequences. The no-holds-barred vilification of opponents has also meant insults have become a principal political weapon. The weaponisation of politics has spawned a culture permeated by incendiary allegations and norm-breaking behaviour. The political fabric is now in danger of being perverted on a more lasting basis.\nWeaponisation of politics has spawned a culture of norm-breaking conduct.\nThere is no doubt that social media has amplified the country’s polarisation and reinforced this political fault line. Again, this is part of a broader worldwide trend. Demagogues and their followers elsewhere have vigorously used digital platforms for political gain by purveying misleading information to manipulate opinion. Here the social media has become a new arena or war zone for a political battle aimed mostly at maligning opponents and disseminating sensational ‘revelations’ about them.\nRecent weeks have seen malicious campaigns by supporters of the former ruling party not only against leaders of the coalition government but also against the country’s military and judicial authorities. Accusations of no less than treachery have been made against almost anyone who doesn’t support this party.\nRead:Army takes 'strong exception' to attempts made to drag its leadership in political discourse: ISPR\nAnonymity on digital platforms gives party activists deniability and frees their trolls from fear of any retribution. That encourages them to continue efforts to create an ‘alternate reality’ by spreading false information. The ‘foreign conspiracy/imported government’ narrative, for example, has been trending on Twitter for weeks even though it doesn’t rest on a shred of evidence.\nApart from influencing gullible minds, social media’s magnifying power generates paranoia by such messages and promotes a hollow form of nationalism in this post-truth environment. By playing off and reinforcing polarisation, messages spread through digital channels that call out others as traitors, are not just deeply offensive but also corrosive of the political system.\nThis brings up another new political fault line. Defiance of institutions be it the judiciary, parliament or the Election Commission, when they do not deliver decisions that suit a particular political party, encourages disrespect for them, breeds cynicism and widens divisions in society. This is now happening on a scale rarely witnessed before.\nRead:SC irked by Imran’s remarks about Nawaz wooing judiciary\nSupreme Court judges have been the target of criticism by PTI leaders who have alsodemanded the resignationof the chief election commissioner. This has translated among the party’s supporters into a blanket rejection of these institutions and refusal to accept their decisions. The most damaging consequence of this is that it rules out resolution of political disputes through institutional means.\nUnwillingness to play by the rules is hugely destabilising for the political system. It can also sow public disorder and lead to a chaotic situation that poses a danger to the democratic system itself. This, sadly, is where the current political situation may be headed today.\nWe have seen in other parts of the world, including our neighbourhood, populist demagogues show contempt for their nation’s constitution and its institutions and upend democratic norms. The question is whether Pakistan’s fragile democracy can survive such assaults at a time when social cohesion itself is at risk from old and new fault lines."}]}

This is unsurprising for a country that has seen repeated military interventions in politics and controversial judicialdecisionsinvoking the doctrine of necessity. But now when both the judiciary and military are acting according to the Constitution, they continue to face criticism.\nToday this criticism comes almost entirely from the former ruling party that wants both institutions to act in its support. When it finds that this is not happening and judicial verdicts are not to its liking its leaders intensify their critique to mount pressure on them to act otherwise.\nRead more:Everyone knows 'neutrals' were not actually neutral during 'regime change conspiracy': Mazari\nThis prompted astatementby the Inter-Services Public Relations warning against dragging the army into politics. It took strong exception to “unlawful and unethical practices” and efforts to involve the military leadership in the “political discourse” by “direct” or “insinuated references”.\nThe higher judiciary too reacted to the criticism. During a hearing last week, Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandialsaidit didn’t behove someone to make insinuations just because a certain judgement did not please him. He said the Constitution unites the federation and the apex court being the defender of the Constitution would continue doing that despite any criticism.\nIn similar vein, the chief justice of the Islamabad High Court, Athar Minallah,askedPTI’s counsel to seek instructions from his party leaders whether they had any confidence in the judiciary. He said from statements made by the petitioner and his party leadership it seemed they had doubts about the IHC’s impartiality and independence.\nCriticismby PTI leaders is not a random act of verbal excess committed out of pique and anger. It is a deliberate political tactic whose aim is to raise maximum public pressure to put both the judiciary and the military establishment on the defensive so that they accede to their demands or, in the case of the courts or Election Commission, rubber stamp the party’s desires.\nThis is politics by intimidation involving as it does criticism directed at state institutions at big public rallies to chants of approval by the crowd. In fact, inferences by the PTI leadership that these institutions may have colluded in the ‘foreign conspiracy’ to oust its government has the effect of denigrating these institutions. Imran Khan has alsodemandedthat the chief election commissioner should resign and accused him of partisanship. He has been mocking sections of the media and often accused those criticising him of doing it at foreign behest.\nThe question is whether the former prime minister and his loyal base realise the consequences of pursuing this political strategy, which is assuming a particularly offensive form in social media and messaging on other digital channels by PTI activists. Defiance of court orders and constitutionally prescribed procedures by PTI holdovers occupying high public offices shows that both in words and deeds there is reluctance to play by the rules and in accordance with the Constitution. This goes beyond a challenge to democratic norms. It is a challenge to the democratic system.\nWhen a significant section of the country is encouraged to deride and mistrust institutions that puts the entire political system at risk. Wittingly or unwittingly, this conduct is putting the party on a destructive path where not just faith in institutions is being undermined but institutions themselves are being delegitimised in the eyes of its supporters, primed now to reject anything at variance with their leaders’ whims. This has serious implications for the constitutional and institutional framework in an intensely polarised country. It is further weakening what distinguished lawyer Salman Akram Raja calls the long-standing tenuous relationship of the urban middle class with constitutionalism.\nThe country’s history of disputed and divisive elections can cast a shadow on future polls.\nThis has a direct bearing on the general election that is widely seen as a panacea for the current political turmoil and the government-opposition confrontation that has all but paralysed the political system and is rendering it dysfunctional. Immediate elections are, of course, PTI’s principal demand.\nMany independent observers also regard elections as the only way to resolve the country’s growing political crisis. But the key question raised by the ongoing attack on institutions, including the Election Commission, is whether the electoral outcome, whatever it turns out to be, will be accepted by the losing side. If a party and its leaders cannot accept a parliamentary outcome in which its loss of majority led to its ouster; if it cannot accept a judicial outcome, which revived the National Assembly it had dissolved, what is the guarantee that it will accept an election result in which it is rejected by voters?\nThere are many precedents of disputed elections. In fact, almost every election outcome has been disputed. In the 2013 elections, when Khan’s PTI lost to PML-N, he alleged vote rigging and called the polls the “biggest fraud” in Pakistan’s history. He demanded investigation into the alleged fraud, launched protests and held a prolonged sit-in for over four months in Islamabad. The roles were reversed in 2018 when Khan won the election. Both PML-N and PPP claimed the people’s mandate had been stolen and ballot rigging deprived the PTI government of legitimacy. In the 1990s, PML-N and PPP took turns to cry foul and accuse the other of winning by unfair means.\nIt is not just this history of disputed and divisive elections that casts a shadow on future polls. The country’s unprecedented polarisation makes even the process leading up to elections highly contentious and uncertain. Consensus on composition of the interim government, which has to be established under the Constitution, will pose the first major challenge. Agreement on the code of conduct and rules of the road will present a greater challenge, especially if PTI continues to voice lack of confidence in the Election Commission. The most consequential question is whether all political contenders will accept the election result so that a way can be found to end the country’s predicament."}]}

A precarious economy needs to be swiftly stabilised before it plunges into an uncontrollable crisis. This urges the need for responsible economic management and efforts to calm down the volatile state of confrontational politics. Unsettled politics is feeding into the deteriorating economic situation. But the delay in taking necessary economic measures is exacting a bigger cost. Uncertainty about elections is also making markets edgy.\nBoth the urgent — averting a financial crisis — and the important — ensuring a degree of political calm — have to be simultaneously tackled as they are interlinked. This challenge has to be met in a domestic setting of sharp polarisation and in a worsening global economic environment. The PML-N-led coalition government has declared itsintentionto continue in office until the National Assembly completes its full term in August 2023. But this is easier said than done. The ‘unity’ government has a razor-thin majority. It depends for its survival on a diverse group of parties, who have to be kept in line by constantly meeting their demands. A majority so slim that a few members can tilt the balance will oblige Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to perpetually look over his shoulder to his allies. This in turn could distract him from governance. It also makes taking and implementing tough economic measures difficult as that will require building consensus among coalition partners, despite their assurances of support for such action. And this when Imran Khan is mounting pressure for early elections. He has already threatened a‘long march’ on Islamabadand a sit-in if his demand for elections is not met.\nMeanwhile, Punjab has been thrown into greater disarray by the Supreme Courtrulingon Article 63-A of the Constitution that votes of dissident lawmakers cannot be counted if cast in violation of their party position. The Election Commission followed with thedecisionto de-seat the defecting legislators who had voted for Hamza Shehbaz as chief minister. This has upended Hamza’s government and may usher in a period of instability.\nPTI has alreadymovedthe Lahore High Court for his removal. Although Hamza has refused to step down, a fresh election of the chief minister is likely. PML-N and the PML-Q/PTI alliance are again locked in fierce competition for chief ministership. When a fresh election is called, if neither side is able to demonstrate a majority after two rounds of voting, the provincial assembly will stand dissolved. Even if PML-N is able to squeak through in a run-off election, it would be a fragile government. With the country’s largest province and political heartland mired in uncertainty, this has implications for the stability of the federal government. Already Punjab has been in a state of paralysis for close to two months.\nRead:Elahi scuttles no-trust move; PML-N resubmits motion\nMore consequential is the precarious state of the economy. Virtually all macroeconomic indicators point to significant worsening of the economy: rising budget deficit, record current account deficit, dwindling foreign exchange reserves, soaring double-digit inflation, mounting debt, growing losses in state-owned enterprises, heavy government borrowing from the central bank and commercial banks, declining investment, and a deeply ailing energy sector that continues to stretch government resources and impose the burden of loadshedding on the public. Meanwhile, thefuel subsidythe previous government announced in its closing days is costing the exchequer over $600 million a month.\nPolitical courage and policy actions are needed to avert an economic crisis.\nIt is the country’s perilous external position and balance-of-payments crisis that has pushed the economy to the brink. Thecurrent account deficit in the ongoing fiscal year is at a record high of $15 billion. Pakistan’s immediate financing requirements this fiscal year are about $5bn — $3bn for the current account gap and $2bn for debt repayments due by June 30. Financing needs next year are estimated to be around $21bn to meet just debt obligations. Foreign exchange reserves are now down to $10bn, which cover just six weeks of imports. As the reserve cushion has depleted so has confidence. This has put more pressure on the balance of payments and sent the rupee into freefall. Its value has sunk to a historic low against the dollar, depreciating by almost 20 per cent in just the past six months. Last week the rupee crossed a psychological barrier by trading atRs200 to a dollar. This adds significantly to Pakistan’s debt.\nMeanwhile,negotiationsbetween the government and the IMF are underway in Doha on resumption of the suspended loan programme. Its revival is necessary for the country to access urgently needed funds not just from the IMF but also other multilateral institutions and bilateral donors. For example, the rollover of a Chinese loan awaits finalisation of the Fund programme. So does Saudi financing. The IMF’s prior condition for resuming the programme is for the government to withdraw the fuel and electricity subsidy. While talks continue, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail is reported to have conveyed to the Fund team “the government’s commitment to undertake reforms envisaged under the programme and to complete the structural benchmarks”. He is expected to join the talks in Qatar this week to try to finalise the package. Why bailout negotiations are taking place in a third country is however beyond comprehension.\nRead:Mounting uncertainties in policymaking\nIf and when the IMF deal is done the government will have to take the tough economic steps it has promised, ensure compliance and also manage their political fallout. Although the prime minister apparently has the support of all coalition partners for this, it will require deft political handling in the face of the anticipated public backlash. Imran Khan will be more than ready to exploit this situation. So political will to stay the course on economic adjustment will be needed. The situation demands courage, wisdom and skill on the part of leadership to deal with the unprecedented economic and political challenges. Otherwise, it is the people of Pakistan who will have to pay the price for policy inaction."}]}

Between Imran Khan’s long march and the government’s use of force, the day’s disturbing events left people in a state of deep apprehension about the future. It remained unclear whether the political storm had run its course or its headwinds would continue to shake the country.\nSooner or later, elections will have to be called. This raises the question of whether this will resolve the ongoing political crisis and pave the way for much-needed stability. To be sure, the road ahead is a challenging one. Agreement on a code of conduct and acceptance of election rules will be far from easy. PTI’s demand to replace the chief election commissioner, who holds a constitutional post, is already a worrisome sign of what lies ahead. In an intensely polarised environment, with emotions running high, it is hard to see how consensus will be forged on the political rules of the road. Will all contestants also believe the playing field will be level for them?\nRead:The case for fresh elections\nLooking ahead, there are other more compelling factors to consider. Will the election results be accepted by all political actors? And assuming — a big assumption — they reluctantly do, what would happen after a likely bitter and bruising electoral battle? This is an important question because the political rhetoric of major parties does not hold out the prospect of stable governance in which a minimum working relationship is established between political rivals. Yet the nature of election outcomes in the past, the country’s diversity and the federal character of the polity should give our political leaders and their followers reason to pause and think. Because this demands an approach of managing the democratic system and running the country on the basis of political accommodation, compromise and tolerance of the ‘other.’\nIf we look at election outcomes in the past two decades, two key aspects stand out. One, no party has been able to secure an overall parliamentary majority, and two, the regionalised nature of the result. In the last four elections — in 2018, 2013, 2008 and 2002 no party won an outright majority. The winning party had to cobble coalitions to form the government. Thus, a fractured vote and hung parliaments have been the norm, not the exception.\nIf politics and economics continue to collide, a bleak future awaits the country.\nAlso significant for the case for consensual governance is the size of the popular vote for the party that won in these elections. It is more useful to assess a party’s actual electoral support by looking beyond the distribution of seats. In the 2018 election, PTI got around 31 per cent of the popular vote. In 2013, PML-N polled 32pc of votes cast. In 2008, PPP secured 31pc. In 2002, PML-Q polled 23pc. This shows that in Pakistan’s first-past-the-post system, the party that has been able to emerge as the single largest and win enough seats to form a government with allies has done so with less than a third of the popular vote. And this is of the votes cast, not the total number of eligible voters. Turnout in these elections has ranged between 53pc (2013), 51pc (2018), 44pc (2008) and 41pc (2002). The large non-voting electorate indicates that significant political ground is not occupied by any party. That puts the mandate of the winner into real perspective.\nAlso read:Popularity and elections\nThe other feature of post-2002 elections is the regionalised nature of the result, which left different provinces with governments of varying political complexions. In 2018, PTI formed the government in KP, the PPP won Sindh, and in Punjab, seats were divided between PTI and PML-N but the former secured control of the province with allies, helped by the establishment. In 2013, the PML-N ran the centre and Punjab, but PTI formed the KP government and PPP the government in Sindh. In 2008, PPP won the national election, while the four provincial polls were won by different parties, PML-N in Punjab, ANP in KP, PPP in Sindh, and a PML-Q-led alliance in Balochistan.\nWhat does all this mean? What lessons does this have for the country’s post-election future? First of all, there is little indication that Pakistan’s era of coalition governments is about to end. If the next election follows the same pattern as in the past, then regardless of who prevails, the winning party will likely poll a minority of the popular vote. Therefore, the notion that the winning party is the ‘sole representative’ of the people and that no one else represents the country has to be discarded. It has to be replaced by the acknowledgment that its mandate is qualified, as other parties also have significant electoral support and must be accommodated and included in the working of the political system. It also means that the ruling party should practise humility in its ambitions and in its conduct. The view that it can wield ‘absolute’ power and govern unilaterally is mistaken. With the support base of under a third of the popular vote, a ‘winner-takes-all’ attitude leads to inherently unstable, exclusionary governance.\nThe country’s federal reality also creates the imperative to work together — not just tolerate opposition-led provincial governments but for the centre to cooperate with them for the public good. In all likelihood, the next election will also produce a regionalised outcome. Thus, the need to adopt a consensual approach for stable and mutually beneficial centre-province relations that breaks from the unedifying past of strains in the federation.\nThe fragile state of the economy creates the most compelling reason for political rivals to work together on a common minimum basis. Governments have been reluctant to take tough decisions to address the economy’s structural weaknesses in large part for fear of political consequences and of the opposition exploiting that to orchestrate a public backlash and provoke discontent. Today, an economy again in the critical ward creates an imperative for post-election agreement among political leaders on remedial policy actions to heal it. All political actors need to think as much about the country’s economic future as their own partisan interests. Without economic stability, everything else will be in vain. If politics and economics continue to collide, the country’s future will be anything but bright."}]}

There is in fact no sign of that. If anything, rhetoric by both sides suggests that tensions might intensify beyond the war of words that has followed Khan’s unsuccessful and ill-advised ‘long march’.\nHe himself abandoned the march when fewer than expected supportersshowed upat Islamabad’s ‘D-Chowk’ and were unable to brave strong-arm action taken by the police including the use of tear gas. While the former prime ministerblamedthe government’s use of force to thwart his march, he conceded his party was not well prepared for the effort, aimed at mounting pressure for early elections. Giving varying explanations at different times, he also said the ‘Azadi march’ ended prematurely as he feared violence because some of his supporters were armed.\nThis unedifying episode has not, however, deterred him or his followers from planninganother march, which Khan says will involve ‘millions’ descending on the capital if elections are not immediately called. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s chief minister Mahmood Khan went further,threateningto pitch the provincial police force against the centre if the march is obstructed. This prompted a swift response from the federal cabinet which announced any future march will be stopped by “full force”. The interior minister warned of more arrests.\nRead more:Imran may be held upon bail expiry, says Rana\nWhether or not Islamabad will see another showdown any time soon Khan believes that protest demonstrations and show of street power are the way to coerce the government to announce elections as well as mount pressure on the judiciary and establishment. He keepsaddressingthe Supreme Court and the establishment directly with his demands. He probably feels that if he relents on these pressure tactics, his goal of early polls will be elusive. He may also be calculating that this keeps his support base in a state of mobilisation, which helps to demonstrate his political power and ensure his followers stay active and charged.\nThe government for its part, may be thinking that forcefully confronting Khan will dissipate his political strength. A strategy of attrition is expected to exhaust his supporters and drain their energies, especially if they face more setbacks like the one experienced in the abortive march on Islamabad. Arrests and FIRs against PTI leaders and activists is part of this strategy. So are efforts to discredit its leadership by charges of malfeasance and corruption against those close to Khan. Press conferences by the official spokesperson focus more on such accusations than setting out the government’s agenda or explaining what the ‘unity coalition’ is doing.\nAn unstable political environment is detrimental to efforts to heal an ailing economy.\nBoth sides seem to have calculated that continuing the confrontation is in their political interest and pays dividends. But there are reasons for them to consider whether their strategies instead entail costs for them. Will playing havoc with public order enable PTI to force early elections? Should the party leadership’s energies not be focused on actual preparations for elections it so desperately wants? After all, large rallies do not automatically translate into votes. Nor can ground work for elections be undertaken overnight.\nIn Pakistan’s constituency-based, first-past-the-post electoral system, party organisation, raising funds, assessment of local politics, identification of ‘electables’ and the right ticketing decisions are the key to success. All this involves time and effort. Amassing people for protest rallies without doing the hard work of crafting a comprehensive constituency-wise election strategy does not take a party very far. Khan must also know that PTI is bereft this time of a party organiser of the skill and experience of Jahangir Khan Tareen, who was credited with PTI’s winning strategy in 2018. All the more reason for him to consider how to compensate for that and direct his party colleagues’ energy early to this task.\nSpending all his political capital on confrontational politics takes his party away from the kind of organisational work needed for effective electioneering down the road. He could also have played an important role if he had stayed on in the National Assembly. But he and his MNAs chose not to, more out of pique than any strategy, even though there was intense disagreement on this in the party.\nRead:PTI to contest by-election on 20 seats in Punjab, says Qureshi\nAlthough responsibility for the confrontation rests squarely with the PTI and its disruptive politics that is roiling the country, the government’s interest should be to calm down the fraught and volatile environment rather than reinforce the inflammatory situation created by Khan. Countering Khan’s challenge is one thing but to be preoccupied with it and adopt a narrative dominated by him is counterproductive. This approach distracts the coalition leadership from governance. The unity government after all needs to demonstrate why it wanted power ahead of scheduled elections and show it can deliver. If the public sees the government overwhelmingly engaged in politicking and countering Khan, it will generate cynicism and encourage people to think that all coalition members were interested in was securing power.\nIn a recentCNNinterview, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said the government would have gone for elections but for the troubled economy as the government’s first duty is to fix that. If that be the case then economic policy should be the predominant focus of the government’s attention and energy.\nProspects of an IMF deal and access to urgently needed financing may have improved by the recently announced fuel price increases, but the government needs to take far more measures to restore economic stability. The more intense the government-opposition confrontation the harder it is to do that and ensure compliance with policy measures in an unsettled environment.\nThe greatest cost to the country of the present political confrontation is that it creates an unstable and unpredictable environment detrimental to efforts to heal an ailing economy. A failing economy cannot be in anyone’s interest. But whether or not the government and opposition accept that the political costs of their strategies outweigh their presumed advantages, the country will continue to bear the cost of unending confrontation."}]}

There is no disagreement on voting by our diaspora. Their right to vote is provided by law. Although the recentamendment of the election lawwas returned by the president to parliament for review, overseas Pakistanis’ right to vote was never in question.\nA joint parliamentary session subsequently adopted the amendment bill. Earlier, while hearing a petition challenging this, the chief justice of the Islamabad High Court said amendments to the 2017 Election Actdid not deprive expat Pakistanis of the vote. The petition waswithdrawn.\nThe key questions in this regard are who is eligible to vote, how should the ballot be cast and what should be the time frame for implementation. A well-researched article published inDawn’s magazineof Feb 27 examines the likely political impact of overseas voting and reaches the striking conclusion that it would be a “game changer” that could even determine the outcome of general elections.\nOver 120 countries and territories today allow what is called external voting. But there are vast differences in the way this is implemented, how votes are cast and criteria for those entitled to vote, including length of stay away from their country of origin. Some countries use citizens’ intent to return to their home country as eligibility for them to vote.\nRead more:Overseas voting\nFew countries, however, have introduced electronic means for external voting. In South Asia, India allows NRIs to vote but only those who retain the country’s passport, are not citizens of another country, and physically present on polling day in their respective constituency. Registration of overseas Indians remains low and only 25,000 are estimated to have travelled back to vote in the last general election. Remote voting by postal ballot is now under consideration. Bangladesh and Nepal are still working on arrangements for voting by their diasporas. Sri Lankan expats abroad don’t have voting rights yet.\nPolitical consensus is essential for the legitimacy of the system that is eventually adopted.\nThe Election Commission of Pakistan was charged by the 2017 Act with enabling overseas Pakistanis to vote. Those entitled to vote are holders of a NICOP card (national identity card for overseas Pakistanis) even if they are dual nationals. Some argue that voting rights should be confined to those who haven’t acquired citizenship of other countries, (several states do this), because they have sworn allegiance to another country and may have ‘divided loyalties’. They also do not have to face the consequences of their vote. But the issue here seems to be settled.\nThere are 8.6 million NICOP holders on the electoral rolls (as of June 2021). According to the ECP, 6.7m are in the Gulf/ Middle East, just under a million in UK and Europe, about 290,000 in the US, 180,000 in Canada and 401,870 in other countries. Of these 5m are on Punjab’s voter lists; 2.2m in KP; 1m in Sindh; 142,325 in Balochistan and 97,744 in Islamabad.\nThe ECP was enjoined by the 2017 law to conduct pilot projects in by-elections to “ascertain the efficacy, secrecy, security and financial feasibility” of such voting. Assisted by NADRA, it did that in 2018 for 35 national and provincial constituencies, which had 631,909 overseas voters. Being the first exercise of its kind only 7,461 expats registered online and just 6,233 voted via the internet. This suggests political parties didn’t show much interest at that time.\nRead:Expats’ votes in LG polls: Implementing i-voting to take a year, Nadra tells court\nIn its report of this experience ECP’s Internet Voting Task Force identified several flaws and challenges that needed to be addressed before the system could become operational for general elections. It recommended a gradual approach starting with elections to non-political bodies and then local polls and by-elections, to enable people to understand the system and allow administrators to test, review and improve it. Significantly it noted that “some of the world’s most technologically advanced countries have either rolled back online voting or have deliberately chosen not to deploy it.”\nWhile the ECP, which has done impressive work, is exploring an appropriate mechanism for external voting, the case for and against online voting by overseas Pakistanis is worth considering. Among its oft-cited advantages are that it offers easy accessibility to a dispersed diaspora, makes for faster counting, simplifies vote management and saves both time and money. Technology however is a double-edged sword. The argument against internet voting is that it is inconsistent with core principles of voting — secrecy and security. Nor does it fully comply with requirements for election integrity. Secrecy of the ballot and voter anonymity are fundamental principles in democracies which internet voting doesn’t meet. The voter verification process too has loopholes.\nElection security is a worldwide concern and raises vexed questions about the threat of cyberattacks and data breaches including by hostile states and hackers. This can even compromise national security giving foreign powers’ ingress into elections. Clone or fake sites can mislead voters and create chaos. How would the uninitiated in an unregulated digital space avoid such minefields?\nAs the majority of overseas Pakistani voters reside in the Gulf and mostly comprise labour it raises the question of whether they would be familiar with the internet to work this system. If they are unable to, the voting method will lack inclusiveness and disenfranchise a large number of expats. It would risk others casting the vote for them, which could open it to manipulation and undermine the election’s integrity. All these problems have to be solved if this mode is adopted. Voters both at home and abroad need to have trust and confidence in the system. Without that it will always be subject to controversy. Already Pakistan has an unedifying history of disputed elections and losing parties refusing to accept results.\nThis calls for careful evaluation and a step-by-step approach in which the ECP determines and then recommends the most secure and effective voting method and timeline for implementation, ensuring no group of expats is disenfranchised. It is examining various voting mechanisms — postal, internet, electronic, embassy in-person. It will have to run pilot tests to ascertain which one is feasible. But it will be up to parliament to approve what the ECP recommends. Political consensus will be essential for the legitimacy of any system."}]}

Several factors seem to point in that direction. Governance problems have mounted in the first instance due to political discontinuities that have punctuated Pakistan’s turbulent history. But today, the challenge of governability is more imposing because of a number of other factors in addition to long-standing ones.\nThe current political polarisation is the obvious new factor. It is unprecedented despite Pakistan’s long tradition of divisive politics. Never before have people, society and families been so divided by their partisan preferences as they are today and resistant to accepting any view other than their own. Theuncompromising stanceof the former ruling party has sharpened this polarisation. It has eliminated any middle ground and made political accommodation near impossible.\nThe confrontation between PTI and the Rest has produced a situation in which parliament has been left without an opposition and the laws it has adopted bereft of wider consensus. As differences appear unbridgeable, finding political solutions to disputes is ruled out. With PTI intent on paralysing the system until it gets its way on early elections, its conduct has created an unsettled environment, making governing more difficult. This is also testing the democratic system.\nRead more:Crackdown on PTI won't help in running the country, says Asad Umar\nThis situation is casting a shadow on state institutions which are increasingly the target of partisan attacks in the raging political battle. Whether it is the establishment, judiciary or Election Commission, if their stance or decisions are seen as favourable to a political party, praise is showered on them. If the opposite happens, they are criticised for being biased.\nImran Khan keepsquestioningthe ECP and judiciary’s impartiality, with PTI trolls often assailing these institutions on social media. Hiscriticism of the establishment, including accusations that it did nothing to stop the ‘foreign conspiracy’ against his government, is a pressure tactic to force it to change course.\nRead:'Why did country's defenders not stop conspiracy?' asks Imran\nSimilarly, Khan has rejected repeatedclarificationsby the military spokesman that there is no evidence to support his claims of a foreign conspiracy. The consequence of this stance is to sow mistrust in state institutions among his fan-like supporters, even beyond his base. This is breeding cynicism and widening divisions in society. Whether or not PTI’s leadership understands the deleterious effects of miring state institutions in controversy it compounds the challenge of governance. Rejection or defiance of the judiciary or ECP’s decisions means undermining a rules-based framework. Trust in institutions is the bedrock of democracy and the governance system, integral to the ability to execute policies.\nThe confluence of polarised politics and economic turmoil is pushing Pakistan into a danger zone.\nIn a political landscape where there is lack of a civil discourse, the exchange of bitter accusations holds sway rather than sober debate on national issues. Discussion of public policy is substituted by fact-free efforts to demonise political rivals. This distracts the government from governing and the opposition from focusing on issues. When the political conversation is only about how venal the other side is national problems are neither seriously discussed nor solutions offered to them.\nWhat has made governance more problematic is erosion in the state’s institutional capacity over the years and the resultant deterioration in delivery of public services, which increasingly fails to meet people’s expectations. Weakening of the instruments of governance has meant that even the most well-devised policy becomes harder to implement.Postponed reforms, piecemeal tinkering and lack of efforts to depoliticise the civil service have weakened the government machinery over time. It has undermined public confidence in government institutions and made governance more onerous.\nThe most important and recurring factor driving the country towards becoming ungovernable are dysfunctional economic policies that have long been pursued. Almost every government since the mid-1980s acted in a fiscally irresponsible way and left the economy in worse shape for its successor to deal with.\nStructural economic problems were left to fester, confronting the country every so often with a financial crisis that became a chronic threat to stability. For the past four decades, failure to mobilise enough domestic resources along with low levels of savings and investment, meant successive governments ranhuge deficitsin national expenditure and on the country’s external account. These twin deficits — budget and balance of payments — were financed by printing more currency notes and the inflow of funds from abroad through borrowing andremittancesfrom overseas Pakistanis.\nReliance on domestic and foreign borrowing and bailouts landed Pakistan in a classic debt trap where more had to be borrowed to pay off old debt. It also left the country living from oneIMF trancheto another. Moreover, bank borrowing at home served as an immensely regressive measure because it meant forced transfer of savings to the government from people least able to bear the burden of inflation, the most pernicious tax on the poor.\nEconomic management that relied on borrowing allowed the country’s ruling elite to avoid and postpone much-needed structural reforms, including serious tax reform, that could have placed the economy on a viable path. It also explains public unwillingness to comply with policy measures imposed on them by an inequitable system.\nThis kind of economic management was reinforced by successive governments — civil and military. A rentier ruling elite created a rentier economy. That is why the structural sources of the country’s chronic financial imbalances have remained unaddressed: a narrow and inequitable tax regime, the energy sector’s circular debt, bankrupt public-sector enterprises, a broken public finance management system, an overvalued exchange rate, heavy regulatory burden and a narrow export base.\nThe chickens have now come home to roost. The country is in the throes of another financial crisis, foreign exchange reserves have depleted, inflation is at an all-time high, power shortages are placing an unbearable burden on people, and an IMF bailout is being sought to avert default.\nIt is true that the Covid-19 pandemic and global economic factors have exacerbated Pakistan’s economic plight.Soaring international oil pricesare further fuelling the balance-of-payments crisis and inflation while global shortages of LNG are compounding the country’s power crisis today. Nevertheless, a weak economy with little resilience to cushion such shocks is the result of poor economic management by reform-averse ruling elites concerned more with preserving their own power than promoting the public interest. The confluence of polarised politics and economic turmoil is now pushing Pakistan into the danger zone of becoming ungovernable."}]}

Sixty-four per cent of the population is under 30 years. Around 47pc of the electorate is between the ages of 18 and 35. A third of total registered voters is under 30. This pronounced youth bulge among voters has transformed the electoral landscape with important implications for politics, political parties and elections.\nBut this has mostly been an understudied factor in recent years, save for Pildat’s ongoing work on youth and Gallup Pakistan’s 2021 report, which assesses exit polls over the years. UNDP’s Pakistan National Human Development Report of 2017 was the most comprehensive examination of the role of youth in human development, that captured the aspirations and expectations of young people. For Adil Najam, co-author of the report, its main political conclusion was that Pakistan’s political culture will be defined in future by the young, and not its elites.\nRead more:'Only 25pc youth cast votes in general elections'\nYoung voters are a potential game changer who can transform the country’s traditional voting patterns. Elections in coming years can be decided by young voters, who are a sizeable constituency — almost 58m in the 18-35 age group. This benefits parties that appeal to the young. PTI is ahead in this game. PML-N and PPP lag behind, even though the latter, in its earlier decades, enjoyed strong support among students. Both parties seem complacent about their ‘stable’ vote banks, which may explain their lack of outreach to the young. They need to rise above the weight of traditional politics and dial their clocks to 2022 to attract young voters.\nA big unknown is whether the young would vote differently than older voters, which is presumed to be largely on the basis of traditional loyalties, personalities, dynastic politics, patronage considerations, ethnicity, biradari alignments or religious reasons. Evidence from other countries shows that voting patterns of youth are different. If they vote differently here, that could be a real game changer. Successive opinion surveys show inflation and unemployment to be young people’s top concerns. So is the quality of education, honest and responsive government and religious extremism. In a recent survey, Voice of Youth, Pildat asked members of a nationally representative ‘youth parliament’ it regularly convenes what inspired them to support a political party. Thirty-eight per cent cited a party’s past performance, 36pc party platform and 17pc charismatic party leadership.\nYoung voters can shape outcomes but they have to turn up at the ballot box.\nThis suggests that issues are more important for them than personalities. The most encouraging finding was faith in democracy of the overwhelming majority — 85pc of respondents. This, despite their mistrust and low confidence in the country’s institutions. According to the NHD report, “never has there been a generation of young people in Pakistan so invested in the future of their country, so aware that solutions to their problems will not come from above or abroad, who know that it is they who can and must be the change that must start from within”.\nBut here lies the paradox. For young voters to play a key if not decisive political role, their participation in elections should be significantly high. So far, turnout among younger voters has been exceedingly low. Official statistics are lacking on this. But the Gallup report, relying on exit polls conducted since 1988, finds youth turnout to be much lower than overall voter participation. It shows that usually only a quarter of young voters turned out to vote. In the past two elections, their participation was only a third compared to the average overall turnout of 52pc. This compares poorly with the turnout of female voters, which averaged 40pc in these polls, although this also affects the youth turnout number. According to Gallup, the highest turnout was among 30- to 49-year-old voters. The head of Pildat, Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, has also examined this phenomenon and refers to the low turnout of youth as ‘absentee voters’, urging changes to promote greater participation.\nAmong reasons deemed to contribute to the low turnout is lack of voter registration and non-possession of CNICs, cynicism that elections won’t change anything, disillusionment with political leaders, and little interest in the political process. Many young voters also doubt the fairness of elections. This is another reason that swells the ranks of the large non-voting electorate.\nAlthough youth voter turnout is low, even a modest rise can be consequential to electoral outcomes. This is due to several factors. The first is the sizeable number of marginal and tightly fought seats in general elections in a first-past-the-post system. Well over a hundred National Assembly seats were won by a plurality, not a majority of votes in the 2018 election. Eighty-seven National Assembly seats were won by a margin of less than 1,000 votes, and 26 seats by a margin of under 2,000 votes. In 51 constituencies, the winning candidate’s margin of victory was under 6,000 votes. Most of these were in Punjab — where general elections are won or lost. With the average size of Punjab’s national constituencies around 780,000, these are fragile margins of victory. Given these margins, young voters can shape outcomes if they participate in elections in greater numbers.\nRead more:Majority of youth believe next general elections will be fair\nA related point is the three-way nature of electoral contests now — between PML-N, PTI and PPP in most national constituencies. In 2018, vote splitting between the two traditional parties enabled PTI candidates to win several marginal seats on narrow pluralities. With the vote dividing between three parties in many constituencies and among others elsewhere, this opens up possibilities for young voters to tip the balance.\nNew voters are continuously added to the electoral rolls — 18.7m voters were registered in the four years since the 2018 elections. Most, though not all, are young voters. Many may not have any prior party preference. This offers opportunities to parties to reach out and win their allegiance. But the youth vote can only be consequential if more young citizens register and turn up to cast the ballot. Some surveys do indicate their eagerness to vote. Political parties should translate this eagerness into mobilising them to vote, while the ECP should facilitate higher registration of young voters."}]}

But that doesn’t detract from its importance as key issues consequential to Pakistan’s future are in urgent need of national consensus.\nThe complex nature of the country’s overlapping challenges and the fact that no single party can tackle these on its own should urge political leaders to rise above partisan interests and consider evolving agreement on core issues even as they continue to compete with each other.\nWhat are these core issues?\nEconomic revival: First and foremost, economic recovery and a plan to achieve this.\nThe economy is obviously not out of the woods. Policy actionsagreed with the IMFto address Pakistan’s financial crisis should not become a source of contention or be politicised, when both the government and opposition know that without a Fund deal the country will be unable to meet its external obligations, repay debt and access financing from other sources.\nBut the IMF programme should be a part of, and not a substitute for, a broader homegrown economic strategy. Stabilisation measures are necessary but not sufficient. Pakistan needs a path to growth and a plan to fix structural problems to end the vicious cycle of high budget/ balance-of-payments deficits and chronic foreign exchange crises that have led to repeated IMF bailouts.\nRead:Up the IMF creek\nUnless underlying structural issues are tackled, the country will not be able to escape from the trap of slow growth, low savings and investment, high deficits, heavy borrowing, growing indebtedness and soaring inflation. A band-aid approach is unsustainable. Consensus is necessary on longer-term, structural measures. As a narrow tax base, reflected in a low and almost stagnant tax-to-GDP ratio, is the source of fiscal problems, serious tax reform is a priority. This should aim at an equitable, simple and nationally enforced regime to give the country a single tax system. Ending exemptions, simplifying the convoluted sales tax structure, and ensuring tax compliance should be part of reform actions. Pakistan also needs to square the circle between over-taxation and under-collection.\nPakistan needs champions of reform, not champions of empty rhetoric.\nThe energy crisis is taking a heavy toll on the economy and testing people’s patience. That gives urgency to power sector reform which requires tough decisions and the widest political support. Similarly, agreement is essential on privatising loss-making, state-owned enterprises that bloat budget deficits. A single, liberal business regulatory framework for the country and commitments for policy continuity are crucial to build and sustain investor confidence. The State Bank’s operational autonomy with the market deciding the exchange rate should also be agreed. An ailing economy cannot be in anyone’s interest.\nRead:On consensus\nConsensual democracy. Political stability, on which economic revival depends, requires consensus between all stakeholders not just on continuance of democracy but its functioning by tolerance and consensus. Democracy shouldn’t be limited to the ballot box. It should determine how the country is governed between elections. The federal nature of the polity makes this imperative. As does the regionalisation of politics and electoral outcomes that leaves different provinces in the hands of political parties distinct from the one controlling the centre.\nThe federal government has to work with and not against opposition-run provinces to build inter-provincial consensus on major issues. While the central government can enact laws and take reform measures, their enforcement requires the consent of all provinces. The role of the military is another crucial area that needs agreement. A firm popular consensus already exists that elected representatives should be in charge of governance. This indicates the delegitimisation of military intervention in politics and governance in public eyes. But political leaders must also embrace this consensus and not seek to drag the army into politics to fight their battles. The military too should respect the principle of civilian supremacy even though on security policy it will continue to have a significant voice. This civil-military rebalancing of power will help to promote political stability.\nRead:Rare consensus among rivals on ISI's role in civilian setup\nEducation: No issue is more consequential to a secure and prosperous Pakistan than the coverage and quality of education available to our children. Yet the facts remain grim.\nPakistan has the world’s second highest number of children out of school — 22.8 million. Twelve million are girls. It means 44 per cent of children aged five to 16 years do not go to school. This violates the constitutional obligation set out in Article 25A that enjoins the state to “provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to 16 years”. Of those who go to school drop-out rates are high.\nAll this is the result of decades of neglect and chronic underspending on education by successive governments. At 2.6pc of GDP, this is among the lowest in South Asia. Just 14 of 195 countries spend less on education than Pakistan.\nGiven Pakistan’s demographic profile, young people face a jobless and hopeless future unless the scale and quality of education is expanded. This should spur the country’s leaders into treating education as a national emergency. Pakistan needs champions of reform not champions of vacuous rhetoric on education.\nPopulation planning: Pakistan’s population of over 224m makes it the the world’s fifth most populous nation. In 2040, the population is projected to reach 302m. The annual growth rate of 2pc is among the highest in the region. This has far-reaching economic and social consequences. Yet this pivotal issue rarely figures in any government’s priorities. The demographic structure, with youth constituting 64pc of the population under 30, means almost 4m young people join the working age population every year. This in turn requires 1.4m new jobs to be created annually, according to a UNDP report.\nThe confluence of demographics, economic stagnation and persisting education and gender gaps confronts Pakistan with the spectre of social instability even social breakdown in the decades ahead if consensus is not forged on population control measures.\nThese fundamental issues among other critical ones, including water scarcity and climate change, will determine Pakistan’s fate and fortunes. They represent tests of leadership for all the country’s political players. Can they rise above their narrow interests and defy the widespread perception that Pakistan is a state bereft of statesmen?"}]}

Offensive remarks by party spokesmen now border on the crude and even vulgar, as exemplified at a recent presser by PTI’s Shahbaz Gill. Not to be outdone in this game, spokespersons of the ruling coalition have also been using unseemly language against the PTI leader.\nRarely has the public discourse plunged to this level — and the general election isn’t even near, as campaign season usually sees an escalation of intemperate rhetoric. Such is the animosity between political rivals, who act as if they are engaged in a terminal conflict, that saying anything and everything to vilify the other is regarded as fair game with nothing deemed off-limits.\nInflammatory statements that fail the truth test are frequently made with little regard for their implications. The no-holds-barred denigration of opponents has turned insults into a political weapon.\nRead:Pakistan’s angry political culture\nOf course, unbecoming conduct was witnessed in the past too, when political leaders traded wild allegations, often during election campaigns. But the uncontrolled language and norm-breaking behaviour on display today is unprecedented.\nThe angry and toxic environment this is creating is in turn giving rise to an unparalleled level of intolerance among followers of rival parties and further dividing the country.\nPeople are left with the impression that power, not public purpose, drives political leaders.\nThe 24/7 broadcast media, especially television talk shows, play off combative politics and reinforce it by pitching political opponents against each other and encouraging noisy clashes. But it is social media that has magnified polarisation and provided a platform for scurrilous political content. Because party activists have anonymity on digital platforms such as Twitter, this minimises the risk of retribution. It is therefore easy for them to disseminate disinformation and unsubstantiated allegations against political foes. The social media has also enabled people seeking partisan sources of information to live in digital bubbles and shut their minds to views different from their own. This produces hyper partisanship and further deepens the political divide.\nFour major consequences follow.\nFirst and foremost, this debases the political discourse and denudes it of focus on serious issues. There is little political debate on policy issues and challenges facing the country, much less on addressing them.\nAt a time when Pakistan’s problems need sober debate on how to solve them, personal attacks and name-calling hold sway. This obviates reasoned or informed discussion. What passes for political debate is dominated by invective, not argument. With unrestrained language becoming the norm rather than exception, this degrades the political conversation.\nRead:Conduct unbecoming\nTwo, this toxic political culture makes the working of the political system near impossible. As the middle ground is eliminated by extreme positions held by political leaders, tolerance, compromise and mutual accommodation needed to make the democratic system work becomes elusive. With the ethic of war — to vanquish the ‘enemy’ — rather than the ethic of competition shaping political behaviour, this rules out efforts to engage rivals, much less show them respect. Rabid partisanship has made the political centre ground shrink, with no one making any effort to bridge or even manage differences.\nMoreover, when both sides accuse each other of treachery or the most egregious crimes, it eliminates room for dialogue and even minimal cooperation in the political process. This exposes the political system to the risk of paralysis and dysfunctionality. What is lost is the obligation to work the political system in the public interest.\nBoycotts, disruptive behaviour and shouting matches are hardly the way for public representatives to live up to their responsibilities. It is certainly not why their constituents have sent them to parliament to represent their interests.\nThis undermines democracy and puts the political system on a slippery slope to democratic erosion.\nThe third consequence is the kind of issue-less politics that emerges in this environment. Rather than focus their competition on public policy issues, political leaders prefer to demonise their opponents. This distracts them from articulating what they stand for and explaining their party programme. It is left to talk show hosts to tease out their stand on national issues, but even then their responses are directed more at berating opponents than explaining their party’s view. This environment is inimical to the generation of new ideas needed to deal with the country’s multiple challenges. It also leaves people with the impression that political leaders are either indifferent to serious issues or the party platforms of erstwhile political rivals have become indistinguishable — as power, not public purpose, drives them.\nEditorial:Uncivilised politics\nThe inescapable impact of this on people is to feed the perception that political leaders are more interested in outdoing each other and unseating the government of the day than in issues of concern to them. Politics is then seen as little more than a power struggle among elites disconnected from the problems and aspirations of citizens.\nConstantly squabbling leaders, accusing each other of sleaze and uncivil conduct, erode public trust. What people want instead is well known and reflected in a recent Gallup poll. This found that a decisive majority of people, 78 per cent, want political differences to be resolved by dialogue and not resort to agitational activity. When this doesn’t happen, public cynicism and disenchantment with both politicians and political institutions follow. This leaves democracy in disrepute."}]}

It is true that Donald Trump’s election defeat was a setback to right-wing populist movements. Many political obituaries were written that both Trumpism and its varied iterations in the world would gradually become history.The Guardianthensaw“the US election result as further evidence that the much-talked-about ‘populist wave’ of recent years may be subsiding”. More recently, the Institute of Global Change, compiled a database ofPopulists in Power, and found the number of populist leaders in power in early 2022 had come down to 13 from 19 in 2019 — the lowest since 2004. It concluded that the wave of global populism had peaked and was in fact in decline. Another research report by Cambridge’s Centre for the Future of Democracy, also determined the tide was turning against populist parties and politicians mainly as a result of mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut while waning electoral support for right-wing populism is evident in some parts of the world, including Europe, and has been a setback for the phenomenon, it has hardly ended the appeal of its ideas or significantly weakened populist sentiment.\nAlthough populism has different expressions across the world, some core ideas are common to most — xenophobic nationalism, an authoritarian, illiberal outlook, anti-establishment, anti-elite stance, notions of racial or religious superiority, anti-immigration, Islamophobic attitude, and disregard for conventional norms. Usually, ideas that exist on the fringe of society are mainstreamed by populist leaders. For example, Trump appropriated many key beliefs of white supremist groups and incorporated them in his politics, according them ‘respectability.’\nThe question is whether the departure of populist leaders from office means their ideas also leave with them. The answer is no, because the appeal of these ideas survives. Many of these beliefs are deeply rooted in society which populist leaders play off, magnify and try to legitimise. Populist thinking usually gains strength from underlying factors such as rising public disenchantment with traditional political parties and the establishment for their failure to meet expectations, especially in times of disruption caused by economic hardship and the uneven impact of ‘elitist’ globalisation. Insecurities and anxieties spawned by this and anti-immigrant, anti-minority sentiment, against a backdrop of economic decline, is fed off and fed into by populist politicians, who direct this against ‘selfish elites’ in the name of the ‘people’. Usually there is already low trust in political institutions seen as unresponsive to public needs. This is exploited by populist demagogues who cast this, as Trump did, as the ‘deep state’s’ anti-people conduct, and then seek to erode independent institutions.\nElectoral support for retrogressive populism may be waning but not the appeal of its ideas.\nAnti-immigration sentiment that holds sway in many Western countries becomes a key element in populist leaders’ narrative. This doesn’t disappear when populist leaders lose power. Xenophobic strains in popular thinking once mainstreamed become part of the political landscape. As right-wing populism uses xenophobic nationalism to mobilise support it plays on people’s fears of being ‘swamped’ by immigrants or minorities. Portraying these groups as threats to society, populist leaders fuel public antipathy towards minorities that often turns to violence and hate crimes, as it has so egregiously against Muslims in India.\nRead:India’s demonisation of Muslims\nNotions of ‘cultural purity’ or ‘nativism’ inform attitudes of significant sections of society and seem to persist. The spread of Islamophobia in much of Europe is a case in point. Indeed, such is the influence of these bigoted attitudes that even leaders like France’s Emmanuel Macron, an ostensible ‘centrist’, borrowed from the populist playbook on Islamophobia in his presidential campaign to defeat Le Pen.\nBoth divisive politics and ideas that right-wing populist leaders espouse reshape the political environment and become more entrenched in society. Polarisation continues. As do populist, ultra-conservative ideas. For example, Boris Johnson used what was called ‘Brexit populism’ to secure office but his ouster doesn’t mean Brexit is likely to be reversed. In the US, Trump’s ideas have become such a key part of the Republican party’s stance that even if he fails to secure nomination for the next presidential election the candidate who does — Ron DeSantis? — is unlikely to discard his populist rhetoric or the substance of his approach. For now, Trump has more support among Republicans than other hopefuls for the 2024 election — a testimony to both Trump’s appeal and narrative.\nEditorial:Rise of right wing\nOne of the most damaging legacies populist leaders leave is deep divisions in the country and diminished public trust in institutions. As the US example and that of other countries show, once institutions are undermined it takes a long time and much effort to restore confidence.\nThere is another aspect to the deliberately orchestrated disrespect and contempt for institutions. As Paul Mason writes in The New European: “The narrative of the populist right, all over the globe, is not simply that human society must go backwards … Their deeper argument is that chaos is good. Amid chaos, transgressive people prosper … Look at the BJP mobs beating Muslims and Dalits. Look at the unrepentant insurrectionists who surrounded Trump on January 6.”\nChaos is therefore regarded as the path to transformative change to realise the ‘vision’ of right-wing populists, however fuzzy that may be. This has a familiar ring in Pakistan where disruption is the strategy being pursued by a party that is an odd amalgam of conservative right-wing populists and affluent members of the middle class.\nFar from receding, the forces of retrogressive populism may be around much longer than thought, not least because the political alternative that can challenge and reverse it remains weak and uninspiring. Some analysts in the West are warning of a ‘second wave’ of populism. That is why the lasting impact of divisive and disruptive ideas should remain a source of worry."}]}

This has raised growing concerns about the fate of a precarious economy in the face of more political turmoil that seems to lie ahead.\nPTI’s stunning electoral victory was obviously consequential for the survival of the PML-N-led Punjab government. But political fortunes reversed in just a few days. In the dramatic events and wheeling and dealing that followed, therun-off electionfor the provincial chief minister took place on a day of surprises.\nAlthough PTI and its ally PML-Q enjoyed a majority in the House an unexpected turn of events saw PML-Q president Chaudhry Shujaat declare he would not support his cousin, Pervaiz Elahi as Imran Khan’s candidate. He instructed party legislators to vote instead for Hamza Shehbaz and conveyed this decision to the deputy Speaker, who then rejected their votes cast for Elahi. This ensured a narrow win for Hamza. But instead of ending the Punjab crisis this outcome is likely to aggravate it. With Khan calling foul, the deputy Speaker’s ruling has beenchallengedin the Supreme Court while PTI has called for public protests against its ‘stolen mandate’. The Supreme Court may well rule against the deputy Speaker’s action.\nMeanwhile, the coalition government at the centre hasmade it apparentit will continue in office until parliament completes its term in August 2023. But the question is how tenable this is, especially with the situation in Punjab mired in confusion.\nEditorial:The decision to stay\nMore importantly, can the fragile economy withstand what promises to be a period of more political turbulence and confrontation between the coalition government and PTI?\nImran Khan will continue to mount pressure on the government to hold immediate general elections. Towards this end, he is continuing to castigate the establishment on the unsubstantiated ground of siding with his political opponents. He also accuses the Election Commission of Pakistan of bias and has repeatedly demanded the chief election commissioner (CEC) — who holds a constitutional post — should resign. This despite his party’s decisive win in the by-elections in which it polled 47 per cent of the popular vote against 40pc for PML-N. Khan cast his party’s electoral success as the ‘defeat’ of both the establishment and ECP that he accused, without evidence, of trying to foil his victory.\nPrevailing in the power game will be in vain if the economy tanks.\nEven if Khan is able to get his way in forcing early elections, uncertainty will not end. He clearly wants a CEC of his choice. This is unlikely to happen. So how will he deal with this eventuality if and when elections are called? This raises a related question. Will he agree with his principal political rival on who should head a neutral caretaker government, constitutionally mandated under Article 224 to oversee elections? Uncertainties don’t end here. In the absence of consensus between the government and opposition on an interim arrangement, the matter goes for decision to a parliamentary committee. If that fails to reach agreement, the ECP has to make that call, under the constitutionally prescribed procedure (Article 224-A)\nFor now, it is the economy that is being adversely affected by political turbulence. The economy is far from being out of the critical ward. True that astaff-level agreementhas been reached with the IMF, expected to go for approval to its executive board in August. This did calm market sentiment, but only temporarily. Both volatility in global commodity and financial markets and political unpredictability at home is eroding confidence. The rapidly declining value of the rupee against the dollar is the most worrying sign of that. The rupee has depreciated by 20pc in the past few months, adding to spiralling inflation. The State Bank has pointed out that some of this depreciation is part of a global phenomenon due to the growing strength of the dollar. But other factors have also contributed over the months. Finance Minister Miftah Ismailattributedlast week’s rupee plunge to a historic low to market panic due to “political turmoil”. While he hopes this will soon recede, continuing political confrontation suggests otherwise.\nRead:Politics of economy\nIn fact, the market will remain nervous until Pakistan gets significant cash injections from the IMF and others.Reportsindicate that the Fund will release the first tranche of $1.1 billion once Saudi Arabia provides SDR (special drawing rights) of around $2.6bn because Pakistan’s financing needs far exceed what IMF can disburse. The finance minister acknowledged in his press conference last week that a “friendly country” would transfer SDRs through the IMF.\nMeanwhile, the recentdowngradeof Pakistan’s credit rating outlook by Fitch Ratings has added to market jitters.\nThe country’s foreign exchange reserves are around $9.7bn, which cover less than six weeks of imports. As the reserve cushion has begun to erode so has confidence. Moreover, heavy external obligations lie ahead — over $30bn estimated for this fiscal year, $21bn to repay debt and $10-12bn to fund the current account deficit. This heightens the risk of a perfect storm. If reserves continue to dwindle, external capital injections prove inadequate or envisaged inflows don’t materialise, panic can take hold in markets even ahead of a cash flow crisis. Confidence can quickly evaporate over the perceived inability of the country to meet its financing requirements. In a scenario where panic sets in and speculative pressures mount, people start converting rupees into dollars as a hedge against risk. This pressure can prompt the central bank to quickly run down reserves. And if the State Bank does not use its reserves, the rupee’s value plunges even more. This in turn can fuel another round of already high inflation, produce a sharp rise in import costs for fuel and of course aggravate the problem of a runaway fiscal deficit.\nThe tenuous state of the economy urges an end to political turmoil and calls for responsible economic management in the months ahead. The fate of the economy is more consequential for the country than who wins the ongoing political battle. Prevailing in the power game will, in any case, be in vain if the battle for Pakistan’s economic stability is lost."}]}

Or ease tensions? Far from it.\nThe latest turn of events has been a huge setback for PML-N as it has lost its provincial stronghold to its political opponents. But these developments have also plunged Pakistan into uncharted territory which could presage more instability ahead. Two governments, at the centre and in Punjab, don’t recognise the other as legitimate and may head towards a collision course.\nThose who thought PTI leader Imran Khan, who has been demanding immediate elections, will ask his ally Elahi to dissolve the provincial assembly to force the coalition government’s hand, were mistaken. Elahi shows no intention of doing this and Khan seems to prefer having control of Pakistan’s largest province to call the shots from there. The PTI is now intent on undermining the federal government from that vantage position and chip away at its authority to bring about its collapse.\nThe country is in fact witnessing a political meltdown.\nParliament has become all but dysfunctional in the absence of the opposition that chose to stay out of the National Assembly to delegitimise it. This is symptomatic of the breakdown of politics. Politics breaks down when political disputes or crises cannot be resolved by political means — and when there is open-ended gridlock with no solution in sight. Political institutions are then paralysed and have no role to play in addressing much less mediating political conflicts.\nConfrontation between the coalition government and PTI and the lack of dialogue between them rules out negotiations to resolve the ongoing crisis. Both look towards the courts to settle essentially political issues and conflicts. This may not be new in the country’s chequered political history but is now occurring with a frequency that underlines the breakdown of politics amid escalating tensions.\nIts impact goes beyond this. It drags the judiciary into the political sphere where it becomes an arena of political contestation and partisan fights in a polarised setting. Because it is asked by both sides to resolve political disputes its decisions are portrayed by one or the other in a controversial light.\nSince his ouster from power, Khan has repeatedly questioned the higher judiciary’s integrity and impartiality. In many speeches he directly addressed the judiciary to mount pressure for favourable rulings. When the SC ruled in favour of his ally Elahi he enthusiastically welcomed it.\nEditorial:An expected change in Punjab\nPML-N leaders have also made statements to pressurise and criticise the Supreme Court. The most telling illustration was the joint press conference by leaders of the ruling alliance on the eve of the SC hearing. Casting doubt on the impartiality of the three-judge bench hearing Elahi’s petition, they voiced their no-confidence in it. Several leaders also recalled ‘selective justice’ it meted out in the past. This expedient rhetoric was designed to serve political ends.\nPolitics breaks down when political disputes cannot be resolved by political means and total gridlock follows.\nAt the same time both political rivals have accused each other of ‘blackmailing’ the judiciary and bringing it into disrepute. This risks making the higher judiciary a casualty of the power game and erode its role as arbiter.\nAdding to controversy, albeit on a different issue, is questioning of the chief justice’s decisions on judges’ appointments by Qazi Faez Isa, senior Supreme Court judge. In a lengthy letter, he said the chief justice was exercising powers “not permitted by the Constitution” and taking ‘unilateral’ decisions.\nDays later the Judicial Commission of Pakistanrejectedall the chief justice’s five nominee judges for the apex court — an unprecedented development. Bar associations across the country had demanded that the seniority principle should be respected and they also called to abridge CJ’s powers to constitute a bench.\nControversies and division in the apex court on such issues erode public trust in institutions. Another institution that is also being targeted is the Election Commission of Pakistan. Khan continues to attack the ECP and demand the chief election commissioner’s resignation.\nThe coalition government for its part is mounting pressure on the ECP to announce its decision on the foreign funding case without delay. The Financial Times report about overseas funds received by the PTI has added grist to its mill. But the government is also insisting it doesn’t want any clash of institutions.\nWith every week witnessing shifts in political fortunes between the coalition government and PTI the prospect is of political tensions continuing. Clearly a deeply troubled economy cannot afford this as it will accelerate its slide into a full-blown crisis with grave consequences for the country.\nForeign exchange reserves are continuing to deplete. The rupee is in freefall. Its value has sunk to an all-time low of Rs240 to a dollar. Economic confidence is eroding by the day. Markets are discounting official statements aimed at calming jittery sentiment.\nWith political confrontation showing no sign of abating and the temperature continuing to rise the repercussions for a struggling economy can be even more deleterious in the coming days. The confluence of political and economic uncertainty is taking a heavy toll on the country’s stability.\nThe danger now is of the political confrontation taking the form of the centre vs Punjab government stand-off. This could paralyse both the federal and the provincial government leading to a systemic breakdown.\nStatements such as that by the federal interior minister ofimposing governor’s rulein Punjab if he is barred from entering the province, are fueling a combustible environment. So are provocative declarations by PTI leaders in the wake of the SC verdict and after assuming control of Punjab. Both sides are doubling down on their positions. This foreshadows a dangerous collision course from which neither side can hope to gain but the country will certainly lose."}]}

The words ‘daku’ and ‘chor’ are now so commonly used that they are firmly embedded in the narratives of all political parties.\nNon-stop smearing of political rivals may be the new normal but it has serious consequences.

This affects the public’s view of leaders, especially when their focus and priority should be on pressing economic challenges and alleviating the hardship people are going through. This does more than cause public disaffection with politicians.\nIt impacts trust in political institutions as they are seen to be little more than vehicles in a power struggle, disconnected from issues of public concern. Alienation from the political system follows. This is corrosive of democracy which needs an engaged and ‘trusting’ citizenry.\nWhen political engagement is disincentivised by people’s perception that politics is shorn of public purpose, the democratic system is undermined. Confidence erodes in governments if they are seen to be driven by narrow political interests and lack competence.\nTrust is a crucial element to make any system work. Low public esteem for political elites and governments can even create a legitimacy deficit.\nPakistan is not alone in experiencing declining public confidence in the political system and governments, irrespective of their political complexion. This now appears to be widespread and is reflected in opinion polls across the world.\nA body of literature has evolved that examines this phenomenon, which has different factors to explain it in various countries. But it also has commonalities.\nAmong the general reasons identified are rising and unmet expectations, a growing gap between political elites and the public, conduct of leaders, governments’ remoteness from citizens, economic performance being critical in people’s evaluation of competence and the information revolution that has empowered people in unprecedented ways.\nA key factor that emerges in the discussion are the negative repercussions of political polarisation in countries, both in the East and West. This is widely viewed as a cause of waning public confidence in political institutions and those in charge of them.\nNon-stop smearing of political rivals may be the new normal but it has serious consequences.\nTurning to Pakistan, the conduct of state institutions also influences public trust. Again, perceptions shape reality.\nInstitutions like the judiciary are questioned when they are perceived to provide uneven and selected justice. It is not a cliché that justice must also be seen to be done. This is an immutable principle of any justice system.\nEditorial:Supreme discontent\nWhen people perceive double standards or unfairness in the application of justice it involves reputational damage. A history of controversial judgements, from the judicial assassination of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to repeated legitimisation of military coups, have bred public cynicism over time about the higher judiciary. Exclusivistinterpretationsof who is ‘sadiq’ and who is ‘amin’ has not helped to dispel scepticism.\nMoreover, when institutions are seen to overstep their role and intervene in domains beyond what is constitutionally permitted it provokes controversy and also diminishes public trust. At times parliaments and the executive have acted in ways that exceeded their constitutionally sanctioned powers.\nBut according to legal experts, so has the higher judiciary on occasion. The most recent illustration was the view of a significant section of the legal community that the Supreme Court’sinterpretationof Article 63-A of the Constitution was tantamount to “rewriting the Constitution”.\nOpinion polls show public confidence in the army is much higher than in other institutions. Even so, the history of military coups and the more recent experience of what is called ‘hybrid’ rule — in which the military involved itself in several aspects of civilian governance — have taken a toll on its public image.\nRead:‘Hybrid regimes’ and their discontents\nThere is more public questioning now of the military’s role in politics and engagements in areas beyond its professional remit — real or perceived. Concern has long been voiced about the implications for democracy of the power asymmetry between elected and unelected institutions. Such is the burden of history that even when the establishmentinsistsit is steering clear of politics and is apolitical, doubts are expressed about these claims. At times criticism is clearly politically motivated coming from political leaders who want the establishment to take their side rather than stay out of politics.\nDoes all of this add up to a crisis of trust in political leaders and institutions? To some extent, yes. But it doesn’t have to be this way.\nTrust can be rebuilt if political leaders learn to rise above themselves and give primacy to public concerns over partisan interests. If they also accept that opponents are not enemies to be vilified and vanquished but rivals in political competition. Confidence in institutions too can be built if constitutional restraints and rules are observed in deeds, not just words."}]}

But PTI contested by-elections for the very seats they vacated. Khan has alsoannouncedhe will be the candidate in all upcoming by-elections for nine NA seats. The purpose is to demonstrate his personal electoral appeal. His legislators continue to retain membership of the Senate. He backed his ally Parvez Elahi in the election for Punjab chief minister and PTI members are now ensconced in the provincial cabinet.\nThis strategy appears contradictory. But it is a politically expedient one designed to serve the objective of mounting maximum pressure on the coalition government — from within and outside the system.\nWhat has been a surprise is that he did not ask Elahi to dissolve the Punjab Assembly, in addition to dissolving the PTI-controlled KP Assembly, which would have forced the federal government to call elections.\nImmediate polls have been Khan’sprincipal demandsince hisousterfrom power. While he continues to issue ‘ultimatums’, he seems content, after seizing control of Punjab, to wait and use the time to galvanise his base, build political momentum and try to weaken the coalition government. He probably figures that the PML-N-led government is losing political ground in the face of tough IMF-dictated economic measures it has been compelled to take. This may help the country to avert default but it is exacting a heavy political price.\nThe ECP’s ruling on the foreign funding case has of course delivered a big blow to Khan and his party’s credibility. To have received “unauthorised funds” from foreign nationals, prohibited by law, has undermined PTI’s self-righteous claims of having the only leadership with integrity that abides by the law. Its response to the verdict has been characteristic — a combination of legal challenges and demonstration of ‘people power’. That, however, may not be enough to end Khan’s troubles on this count which could involve a bruising and long legal battle.\nWhatever political manoeuvres his party engages in — accusing the chief election commissioner of political bias and protests against ECP — there is no escaping the fact that Khan cannot place himself above the law. The misdeclaration he made to the ECP has consequences.\nThe coalition government has directed FIA to launch aninvestigationinto the prohibited funds case. But it is overreaching with claims by some federal ministers that the ECP verdict is enough to proscribe PTI.\nAs many constitutional lawyers have pointed out there is no legal basis for such action. Politically such a move would be disastrous. Pakistan’s history testifies not just to the futility of such action but to its lasting deleterious repercussions for the country’s politics.\nPolitical leaders should set aside their partisan interests to agree on a pause in their confrontation.\nThat doesn’t mean PDM parties will resist using the ruling to move the Supreme Court for a determination of whether Khan is ‘sadiq’ or ‘amin’ — invoking the very constitutional clause used to disqualify former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for life. If it was a questionable and politically motivated determination then, invoking it now would be just as controversial.\nHaving said that the law has to follow its course which obliges PTI to respond to ECP’s show cause notice to explain why it should not seize the prohibited funds.\nRead:Risk of a perfect storm\nMeanwhile, Khan’s strategy to take on all the country’s institutions is proving to be imprudent and counterproductive. He has criticised the judiciary when it has given an unfavourable ruling, assailed the ECP and launched virulent attacks on those he calls ‘neutrals’ ie the army.\nEncouraged by his combative rhetoric, his chief of staff’s vitriolic utterances crossed a red line on television by calling on members of the armed forces to disobey their high command’s orders. The private news channel that broadcast his comments was issued with ashow case noticefor airing “hateful and seditious” content tantamount to “incite the armed forces towards revolt”.\nThe channel was taken off air and Shahbaz Gill wasarrested. If this is part of PTI’s strategy to mount pressure on the establishment it is clearly backfiring.\nAgainst this unedifying backdrop, the country celebrated the 75th anniversary of its independence with the future clouded in uncertainty and the prospect of more political turmoil. Rarely has the country been so divided. Its diamond jubilee should have been marked by a demonstration of national unity and solidarity. Instead, Pakistan celebrated this historic milestone in an environment of political polarisation and economic fragility.\nAt this important juncture, no political leader in and out of government, has taken the long view and gone beyond immediate political considerations, to offer a vision or road map of where they want the country to go from here.\nAll governments in the recent past have been preoccupied with politicking and operating in crisis management mode, postponing reform and looking for pain-free, short-term economic ‘solutions’ rather than a longer-term approach to deal with the country’s festering structural problems.\nThe interplay between politics and the economy is consequential for the country. For decades, dysfunctional politics and fiscally irresponsible economic policies have reinforced each other to contribute to the crisis Pakistan faces today.\nThe only way out of this crisis is for political leaders to set aside their partisan interests and agree on a pause to their confrontation. Their focus should instead be on the formidable challenges confronting the country.\nMost overlap and have been feeding off and reinforcing each other in an unbroken, vicious cycle over the past many decades. They include the structural crisis of the economy, erosion of the state’s institutional capacity, the education deficit, unrestrained population growth, environmental degradation and growing intolerance in society. Security challenges also endure with an unstable Afghanistan on the western frontier, a hostile India on the country’s eastern flank and resurgence of militant groups within the country.\nCan the country afford the political turmoil and power struggles in play today when such imposing challenges wait to be addressed?"}]}

But given the turbulent state of politics, there is little reason to be sanguine about the country’s political and economic future.\nConfirmation that the Fund’s executive boardwill meet next weekto approve the loan programme has helped to strengthen the rupee and revive market confidence. It also resulted in a largely buoyant week at the stock market.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has, in anessaywritten forThe Economist, called the IMF programme the “path to safety”. But political turmoil continues to cast a shadow over the economy. The nexus between economic recovery and political uncertainty is not to be underestimated.\nUnder attackby both his own party and his government’s principal coalition partner, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail has stood his ground by taking painful but necessary decisions to close the deal with the IMF and thus avert the possibility of default by the country. The acting governor of the State Bank, Murtaza Syed, also played a key role by skillfully managing a difficult situation. Under his stewardship, the central bank issued thoughtful statements, ensured the exchange rate remained market-driven and made the right, though politically unpopular, decisions on interest rate policy.\nThe finance minister continues to face criticism from his party colleagues. But he has been straightforward about the austerity measures the government has had to take to prevent a meltdown of a precarious economy.\nThe political situation, however, is not proving to be an ally of the government’s goal to stabilise the economy.\nThe confrontation between the coalition government and opposition leader Imran Khan has assumed an ominous shape afterPTI secured control of Punjab. The centre and the provincial government are now locked in a stand-off and tit-for-tat actions that are creating more political disarray. Thetusslebetween the two over the custody of Shahbaz Gill is a case in point. As are thearrest ordersissued by the Punjab government and police raids on the homes of PML-N leaders, who then fled the province.\nThe federal government, for its part, has been stepping up its drive against Khan over the foreign funding case, ordering theFIA to launch an investigationinto PTI’s ‘prohibited funds’. Discord continues over the transfer of civil servants. The centre-province wrangle and the politics of settling scores has plunged the country into a vortex of turmoil and uncertainty.\nMore seems to be in the offing. Encouraged by the large crowds he has drawn, and his support base remaining unaffected by allegations of malfeasance by his opponents, Khan is in no mood to dial down political tensions. Neither is the Sharif government.\nEditorial:Charter of the economy\nEven though the prime minister hasstressed the needfor a “national dialogue” to evolve consensus on an economic charter, his government has done little to further this objective, perhaps because it sees this as an exercise in futility in the present fraught environment.\nThere is a close nexus between economic recovery and political certainty.\nThis means tempestuous politics will continue to heighten economic risk, keep markets edgy and investors in a hesitant state. Moreover, rifts within the PML-N and divisions on economic policy among coalition partners have raised doubts about whether the government will stay the policy course agreed with the IMF.\nThe burden of history rests heavy in this regard, given Pakistan’s stop-start record of previous Fund programmes, which earned it the reputation of being a one-tranche country. Therefore, questions continue to be raised about the longevity of the IMF programme.\nThe IMF deal in any case is a necessary but not sufficient guarantor of economic stabilisation, much less of durable economic recovery. The programme itself is not just about fulfilling prior actions but staying on track, implementing measures over time and rebuilding trust with international financial institutions. The Fund has already cautioned the government it might have to take additional measures “given the elevated uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets”.\nRead:Prioritising economy over politics\nPakistan has faced many balance-of-payments and liquidity crises in the past. But never before has it confronted a financial crisis in such an adverse external environment, in which the aftershocks of the Covid pandemic and the fallout of the Ukraine conflict have left supply chains and global commodity and financial markets in such a volatile state. Energy and food prices have soared and fuelled worldwide inflation, exacerbating Pakistan’s economic difficulties. This at a time when global interest rates are rising, leaving indebted countries particularly vulnerable.\nPolitical uncertainty has many damaging effects on a struggling economy. The exchange rate in particular is a barometer of such uncertainty as it is determined both by economic fundamentals and sentiment. Uncertainty affects the exchange rate as both inflows (foreign investment, remittances, export earnings) and outflows (imports and portfolio flows) are impacted by sentiment. This leads to weakening of the rupee, as the experience of recent months testifies. Depreciation of the rupee in turn fuels higher debt-financing costs and inflation.\nMoreover, the most important indicator of the country’s growth path — and of sustained recovery — is the level of private investment. Even with the most robust policy actions, political uncertainty can vitiate the investment climate and dampen investor sentiment.\nPolitical polarisation has another deleterious economic impact in Pakistan’s federal system. The central and provincial governments regulate different aspects of the investment environment. The federal government provides tax stability, the central bank external stability, while provinces have to foster a secure and conducive climate for investment to take place. But when politics is so divided and the centre and provinces at loggerheads, this acts as a disincentive for the private sector, which then prefers to sit it out. This diminishes chances of a sustainable economic rebound that clearly depends on new investment.\nThe irony is that all major political parties actually agree on the fundamental elements of economic policy — export-driven growth, curbing the fiscal deficit, instituting an equitable and simplified tax system, ensuring tax compliance, creating a business-friendly environment, adhering to a market-determined exchange rate, privatising bankrupt state-owned enterprises, bringing down inflation, reducing the debt level and restraining government expenditure. Despite this convergence, their efforts to seek political mileage drives them in the opposite direction, which puts the accent on their divergences at the cost of the country’s economic stability."}]}

After J&K’s illegalannexation, bifurcation and integrationinto the Indian union three years ago, Delhi has used force and fraud to maintain its unlawful hold over the region.\nAug 5, 2019, opened a new chapter in the tortured history of the occupied territory intensifying the plight of the Kashmiri people. A prolonged cruel lockdown and communication blackout was imposed, the military siege tightened, the press muzzled and Kashmiri leaders jailed to prevent a popular upsurge against the move that took away virtually all the rights of the Kashmiri people. International human rights organisations reported widespread torture and arbitrary arrests, with thousands picked up from their homes and children blinded by the use of pellet guns. The latest report of India’s Forum of Human Rights in J&K found that human rights abuses have continued unabated. They include “arbitrary detention, prohibition on public assembly and mass imprisonment”. It also noted the “severe clampdown on the press” and that sedition laws continue to be used against political leaders and journalists.\nSince August 2019, the Modi government has used sweeping and repressive measures to consolidate its control and take steps to eventually hold elections there to ‘legitimise’ it’s illegal actions. These efforts have involved drawing from the electoral fraud playbook to disempower Muslims in the occupied territory. Its latest move earlier this month kicked up a veritable storm in Kashmir. Theannouncementby the chief electoral officer in the occupied valley, to grant voting rights to any Indian citizen, even temporarily residing there, marks another attempt to change the region’s demography. This is a brazen violation of UN Security Council resolutions on Kashmir as was the August 2019 action. There are 11 UN resolutions on Kashmir. Specifically, the move contravenes UNSC resolution 38, whose para 2 clearly states that neither party to the dispute can bring about a material change in the situation in Kashmir.\nThe action aims to add almost 2.5 million additional voters, including non-locals, to the electoral rolls. This represents an increase of 30 per cent more voters to the electorate. The announcement provoked fury and resentment in the valley. Leaders of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) denounced the new election measure. It was also rejected by traditionally pro-Indian political leaders. Mehbooba Mufti, head of the People’s Democratic Party, described it as the “last nail in the coffin of electoral democracy”. She accused the BJP of trying to execute a “Nazi Germany or Israeli policy” in Kashmir. Former chief minister Farooq Abdullah’s National Conference asserted that “inclusion of non-locals” was a “clear-cut ploy to disenfranchise the people of J&K”.\nIndia’s actions have sought to disenfranchise and disempower Kashmiri Muslims.\nPakistan strongly condemned the move. The foreign ministry called it “a clear manifestation of the treacherous Indian design to influence the outcome of so-called elections” in occupied J&K. It also called on the Indian government to desist from actions that violate international law, the UN Charter and the fourth Geneva Convention. A Kashmiri journalist, who did not want to be named, told me that “announcing that domicile certificates were not necessary for inclusion of 2.5m new voters in the electoral rolls completes the process of turning a numerical majority into a political minority”. This, he added, “will go down in history of how to disempower a majority and make them subservient to a minority”. In fact, this measure and earlier ones resemble Israel’s illegal settler policies and are typical of methods used by occupiers.\nThe trajectory of Indian actions over the past three years shows the patent Indian intent to disenfranchise Kashmiri Muslims and impose a BJP government on the occupied territory after fraudulent polls. Towards this end, Delhi has sought to bring about administrative and demographic changes and recast the electoral map to give Jammu greater representation and reduce Muslim representation in order to shift the political balance to Hindus. In May this year, India’s Delimitation Commission carved out new electoral constituencies in J&K that disempower the Muslim population.\nMuslims constitute over 68pc of J&K’s population while Hindus are about 28pc, according to the 2011 census. Modi aims to turn this Muslim majority into a minority. The delimitation handed Jammu six more seats in the 90-member J&K Assembly while Kashmir was given only one more. Under this plan, Jammu would have a total of 43 seats, leaving Kashmir with 47. This despite the fact that, according to the 2011 census, the Kashmir Valley’s population was seven million while Jammu’s was 5.3m. Estimates of the present population of Kashmir are of course higher.\nThe move was roundly rejected across Kashmir. APHC leaders, who remain in detention, denounced it and sham elections in the future. Pro-Delhi Kashmiri politicians called the plan unacceptable as it sought to alter Kashmir’s demography. Prominent Indian intellectuals also decried the delimitation saying it was a violation of the principle of one man one vote. The Forum of Human Rights in J&K demanded that the delimitation plan be shelved.\nThe question is whether by such blatant gerrymandering India’s ruling party can accomplish its political aim in Kashmir. Given the strong opposition and overwhelming condemnation of its plans by the Kashmiri people, the short answer is no. For over 70 years India has tried in vain to foist a regime on Kashmir that has always been rejected by the majority of people. It has jailed Kashmiri leaders but failed to ‘imprison’ the popular aspiration for freedom from Indian occupation. Delhi’s policies of oppression and subterfuge have been a failure in Kashmir and only intensified the alienation of its people. If and when so-called elections are held, they will be a sham exercise boycotted by most Kashmiris, like previous ones. The only way the dark era in Kashmir can end is if the issue is resolved in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people and UN resolutions. Until then, its tragedy will continue and South Asia will be denuded of peace."}]}

Not so this time in Pakistan.\nTheworst floodsin the country’s history should have urged political rivals to set aside their partisan interests and offer a collective response to the catastrophe. But this was expecting too much. Politics was back to business-as-usual save for a few days after the deadly monsoon began to wreak unprecedented devastation across the country.\nThe most egregious example of this was theletterwritten by KP’s Finance Minister Taimur Jhagra to the federal government that the PTI-run provincial government was unable to deliver a budget surplus. Sent — and made public — just days before the IMF board was to meet to consider a loan package, the only intent of the letter was to upend the bailout.\nUnder the terms of the IMF deal all provincial governments were required to generate a fiscal surplus, which they had committed to do, in writing. As shocking was the leaked phone conversation between Jhagra and the former federal finance minister in which both acknowledged this would damage the country but went ahead with the letter. The Fund programme was of course not derailed. Board approval on Aug 29 paved the way for disbursement of the first tranche needed for Pakistan to avert the risk of default.\nThe humanitarian crisis confronting the country, in the face of an imposing economic challenge and soaring inflation, warrants a unified response. It needs political leaders to come together to deal with a disaster of epic proportions. But this hasn’t happened.\nMeanwhile, the enormous displacement and destruction caused by floods from the exceptional monsoon rain has spread more widely. This calamity is principally the result of climate change, responsible for 90 per cent of natural disasters in the country over the past two decades. But it has been exacerbated by ill-conceived or illegal river and canal bank constructions.\nThe situation is far more dire than it was in 2010 when super floods last overwhelmed the country. Already more people have been impacted — over 33 million — and vast swathes of land, almost a third of the country, inundated by floodwaters. Eighty districts were declared calamity hit with 110 districts affected by the disaster. Destruction of homes and infrastructure and damage to crops has been substantial.\nThe death toll has alreadyexceeded 1,200including hundreds of children. Livelihoods have been destroyed. Eighteen thousand schools have been washed away. Continuing flooding, inclement weather, transport disruption and damage to infrastructure hampered relief and rescue efforts. Images of desperate survivors in a sea of suffering have been heart-wrenching. Half a million people are in camps. The economic costs of the catastrophe are initially estimated at around $10 billion.\nThe exemplary public role should have been matched by unity and solidarity among political leaders.\nThis calamitous state of affairs did little to dissuade some political leaders to pause their confrontational politics and cease their divisive rhetoric at least for the time being. The PTI, for example, went ahead with its public rally in Jhelum in the midst of chaos in the country.\nIn his address, Imran Khan again struck a confrontational note while saying his party will do everything to assist and rehabilitate flood victims. Responding to criticism hesaidhe will continue to hold rallies in floods, heatwaves and ‘even war’.\nAnd he carried on with rallies in other cities with his tone becoming even more combative. At one rally, a PTI lawmaker called on overseas Pakistanis not to send funds for flood relief in response to the federal government’s appeal.\nRead:Focus on politics at the cost of lives\nThe coalition government mounted its relief operations with Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif offering to work with the opposition at a time of national emergency and holding out an olive branch to Imran Khan. But the PTI-run provincial administrations in KP and Punjab made little attempt to reach out to the centre.\nInstead, KP’s chief minister made the disingenuous claim that the federal government had failed to help and said no contact had taken place between his provincial government and the centre since the floods. Punjab’s chief minister asked Imran Khan and not Islamabad for assistance. Instead, Pervaiz Elahi seemed preoccupied with a dispute with the IG police over the appointment of district police officers.\nA high-level meeting last week presided over by Prime Minister Sharif and attended by service chiefs took stock of the situation and evolved comprehensive relief and rehabilitation plans. It was boycotted by PTI’s chief minister in KP and Punjab’s Pervaiz Elahi, although both were invited along with other CMs. The chief secretaries of these two provinces attended but Khan directed their political bosses to stay away.\nSeveral PML-N leaders assailed this conduct and renewed their partisan attacks on PTI on other counts. Several coalition government leaders continued to lash out at PTI, which further escalated tensions.\nMeanwhile, Khan made it plain that funds he was raising would only be given to Punjab and KP, with histelethonsecuring record pledges from overseas Pakistanis. This divided response from political leaders presented an unedifying spectacle at a time of a national emergency.\nThe bright spot in this bleak landscape was the commendable response from the public and local communities.\nGenerous support is characteristic of the people who have a long-standing record of philanthropy. NGOs and private charities all rose to the challenge and got volunteers on the ground in areas they could access. Media coverage highlighted where assistance was urgently needed. Civil society, the business community, media houses and citizens across the country organised efforts to help the flood victims. Members of local communities who risked their lives to save others provided exceptional examples of courage and heroic action. As did the round-the-clock relief and evacuation efforts by local officials — men and women — in several areas. The capacity for endurance of the afflicted also stood out as testimony to the dignity and resilience of the people.\nThe exemplary role of the public should be matched by a display of solidarity among political leaders and parties. But this continues to be in short supply.\nAn important question raised by the calamity is whether the country’s political leaders can still demonstrate the unity and collective resolve needed in the months ahead to steer the ship of state through these stormy waters to safer shores."}]}

Announcement of abillion-dollar arms package for Taiwan, on the heels of controversial visits byUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosiandother congressional membersto Taipei, prompted an angry response from Beijing.\nChina’s foreign minister described Pelosi’s visit as “manic and irresponsible” and Beijing warned relations would be “seriously jeopardised” by the arms sales. Washington also stepped up the tech war with fresh curbs on US exports of chip technology to Chinese companies. This led Beijing to accuse the US of imposing a “technological blockade” out of an exaggerated notion of national security.\nRising tensions now have the hallmark of a new cold war. Despite their economic interdependence the two global powers are locked in a dangerous confrontation. The US is embarked on a policy to contain China while Beijing has made it evident that while it doesn’t want a crisis it will act assertively to protect its interests and counter American actions.\nRead:Pakistan willing to bridge US-China differences, says Shehbaz\nChina’sheightened military activityand exercises including firing conventional missiles around Taiwan in response to US actions, has signalled it is prepared to mount military pressure on Taiwan. The US, for its part, has been increasing its military presence there.\nIn the two years of his presidency, Joe Biden has pursued a hawkish line on China, quite indistinguishable from his predecessor Donald Trump’s approach that saw the US impose wide-ranging trade tariffs on Chinese exports, deploy belligerent rhetoric and take actions seen as provocations by Beijing. This hardline policy has been driven by Washington’s growing fear of a rival superpower’s increasing economic, military and technological power, seen as a threat to US dominance. Biden’s stance also reflects political consensus in the US that views China not just as a competitor but an adversary to be contained. The upcoming midterm congressional elections may be an added factor in the Biden administration’s combative stance to make the Democratic Party look tough on China.\nThe world’s most consequential relationship between the US & China needs to be managed responsibly.\nTensions over Taiwan have been taking a perilous course. Chinese leaders have repeatedly warned Washington of a tough response if Beijing’s red line is crossed — encouraging ‘separatist forces’ towards the independence of Taiwan, which China regards as an inalienable part of its territories. The US insists its ‘One China’ policy remains unchanged but Beijing sees willful violation. Meanwhile American officials continue to voice opposition to “unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait”. During his visit to Japan in May, Bidendeclaredhe would be willing to use military force to defend Taiwan if it was invaded by China. This evoked strong condemnation from Beijing that accused Biden of “playing with fire”.\nOpinion is divided among experts over whether present tensions can escalate and eventually result in military conflict between the US and China. Several former American officials and Western analysts warn against such an outcome. Henry Kissinger for one has cautioned the Biden administration against “endless confrontations” and letting domestic politics overshadow “the importance of understanding the permanence of China”. He warned that the two can drift into conflict which will produce a catastrophe on the scale of World War I. Former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd also believes any conflict would be disastrous. In his bookThe Avoidable War, published earlier this year, he makes the case for “managed strategic competition” between the two superpowers and says that evolving a “joint strategic framework” might help them find a way to coexist without compromising their fundamental interests and thus avert the risk of war.\nIan Bremmer offers the compelling argument that a US-China collision, with other countries expected to choose sides, would prevent the world from addressing the three impending global crises — pandemics, climate emergency and life-altering disruptive technology. A cold war, he reasons in his new bookThe Power of Crisis, is not inevitable. A partnership between rival powers, who engage in “well-coordinated competition”, could help meet the world’s most pressing challenges.\nThese hopeful scenarios are not yet playing out in Sino-US relations. If anything, expectations of de-escalation of tensions and stabilisation of ties have not materialised. Developments point in a different direction. Last year the USforged a new trilateral security pactwith the UK and Australia named AUKUS. This aims to enhance Australia’s naval power by nuclear-powered submarines to counter China’s military ascendancy in the western Pacific. Apart from its nuclear proliferation implications, this further reinforced in Beijing’s mind that Biden had embarked on a strategy to contain China.\nMore recently, Biden’sfive-nation May trip to Asiawas designed to cement the anti-China coalition as well as offer so-called Indo-Pacific states an ostensible alternative to their close trade and investment ties with China. The second in-person meeting of Quad countries — US, Japan, India and Australia — also took place in Tokyo in May. The Quad was resuscitated with the express purpose of countering China. The statement issued after the summit did not name China but the reference was clear when it declared resistance to “any coercive, provocative or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo” in the Indo-Pacific. Similarly, the announcement that Quad nations would invest over $50 billion in developing infrastructure in the Asia-Pacific region was also aimed at offsetting China’s growing influence.\nWhile there is no confirmation yet, a summit meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Biden is likely on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Indonesia in November. This will be their first face-to-face encounter. Their previous conversations, by phone or video, have helped clarify their positions and sought to build what Biden called “guardrails” to prevent an inadvertent drift into conflict. But they did not produce a lasting thaw in their frosty ties. Whether the meeting in Bali can help stabilise fraying relations is yet to be determined as both global powers do not want any military collision. What is apparent is the need for the world’s most consequential relationship to be managed responsibly to avert a breakdown, even conflict. The future course of Sino-US relations has far-reaching consequences for the global economy, international peace and security and dealing with a range of shared challenges."}]}

But with that comes an opportunity to rebuild lives and make the country resistant to the ravages of climate change.\nThe challenge is to plan for a future in which this threat to human security is mitigated and managed effectively. Along with navigating a crisis that has aggravated the country’s economic predicament, the task ahead is to reverse the setback to human development experienced by the country in recent years.\nThe latest Human Development Report (2021-2022) points out that the past two years have had a devastating impact on countries across the world. For the first time, human development hasdeclinedin nine out of 10 countries.\nThe UNDP report describes features of the current fraught and unsettled environment that also prevail in Pakistan. “We live in a world of worry,” says the report. Reversals in human development have taken place almost everywhere due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with more human suffering occurring in the wake of the Ukraine conflict. For two consecutive years, the global Human Development Index (HDI) value declined. A “cost-of-living crisis” is afflicting nations, regional conflicts continue and record-breaking temperatures and storms reflect the extreme stress the planet is under.\nRead:Beyond the rescue\nThe report, Uncertain Times, Unsettled Lives, says this kind of “uncertainty complex” has never been witnessed in the past. It has three volatile and interacting elements: destabilising planetary pressures of the Anthropocene, pursuit of sweeping societal transformations to ease those pressures, and intensifying polarisation. This is described as the new normal.\nThe report also underscores that even before the pandemic, the world saw the erosion of democracy, increase in people’s insecurity, as well as alienation with their political systems. In a finding that will be familiar to people in Pakistan, the report warns of the peril of “new uncertainties” in insecurities, demagoguery and polarisation evident in many countries. Trust is declining, hyperinformation is sowing division, political extremism is increasing, while paralysis has emerged as the paradox of our age.\nWith devastating floods adding to the cascading economic and political crisis in Pakistan, the country’s ranking on the global human development index may fall even further. The report shows Pakistan has already dropped seven places to 161 out of 191 countries and now joins the world’s 32 low human development countries.\nIn 2020, Pakistan’s ranking was 154 of 189 countries. Sri Lanka is ranked 73, Bangladesh 129 and India is at 132. HDI is a measure that evaluates long-term progress in three aspects of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a reasonable standard of living. Pakistan’s low ranking is a reminder of the long way the country has to go in this regard.\nDivisive politics during the ongoing climate calamity has denuded the country of a unified response.\nUNDP’s Human Development Reports have always produced quality analysis and shone a light on how to address challenges in this critical area. But the latest report surpasses previous ones for its insightful review of the state of play, rich discussion of a range of contemporary phenomena fuelling our age of uncertainty, and what to do about it. The report also contains thoughtful essays by an array of experts on wide-ranging issues germane to human security and development.\nThe report considers the rise in polarisation within and across countries. Its discussion of the drivers and consequences of polarisation is especially instructive. Uncertainties of different kinds, human insecurity and an unsettled environment increase polarisation. Inequalities and disruptive changes in information systems also sharpen polarisation. One consequence of the “confluence of heightened uncertainty with high inequality” is the rise in support for authoritarian leaders.\nSeen as an impediment to purposeful action to address challenges, intensifying political and social polarisation has a paralysing effect and undermines the ability to act collectively. Above all, it delays action to curb human pressures on the planet.\nSo even when problems and solutions are clear, there is “a failure to act”. The report argues that “polarisation can take dangerous forms when different groups operate with entirely different sets of facts and, thus, realities, especially when those realities are bound up with group identities”. This is enabled by new digital technologies.\nPolarisation at the elite level leads to polarised views among people, who then become “more tolerant of undemocratic behaviour”. What the report calls ‘hyperinformation’ is seen as “powering social division and polarisation”.\nRead:Reform, relief, resilience\nThere is much here that resonates in Pakistan, where the interplay between political unpredictability, multiple deprivations and insecurities, economic hardship and rising inequalities have provided an enabling environment for heightened polarisation and for the growing influence of populism. The populist narrative that taps into declining public trust in institutions by portraying them as ‘elitist’ and unresponsive to people’s needs finds widespread traction in our society.\nDigital and social media is further reinforcing divisiveness and polarisation. Its disruptive impact here, as elsewhere, comes from non-fact-based information and the fake news it so easily spreads. The crisis of national unity that political polarisation has created casts a long shadow over Pakistan’s future — and its ability to meet the complex challenges it has to negotiate.\nDivisive politics during the ongoing climate calamity, which has also involved some parties stoking controversy over flood donations, has denuded the country of a coordinated and unified response.\nTo return to the report, the most important takeaway is its central argument that harnessing human development is the surest means to navigate uncertain times, as they open possibilities for transformative change. This is because at such moments, people see the need for change and also because of new opportunities offered by technological innovation and advances in science and medicine. Shocks, it suggests, creates openings for policy change.\nThe report calls for policies that focus on investment, insurance and innovation to help people negotiate uncertainties, keeping in mind the ineluctable reality that people are the real wealth of a country. Wise counsel that needs to be acted on."}]}

This dire situation held great peril, especially with trust declining in democratic institutions, respect eroding for international law and faith diminishing in international solidarity. Despite “the logic of cooperation” there was no “collective problem solving”.\nThe UN chief called for “a coalition of the world” to redress this alarming situation. Warning of a “winter of global discontent” he said a splintering world needed hope and action. And above all, “common solutions to common problems”.\nIt was but obvious that Guterres would mention the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the devastation caused by the war. But any expectation that his words would calm the situation was quickly dashed.\nRead:New world order\nA day after his speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a further escalation of the seven-month crisis. He said hundreds of thousands of army reservists would be deployed in Ukraine in a partial mobilisation of Russian forces. He also threatened to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia. This followed his plan unveiled earlier to hold ‘referendums’ in Ukraine’s four regions under Russian control in a bid to ‘formally’ integrate them into Russia. Voting on this has already begun.\nThese moves came on the heels of a series of military and diplomatic reversals for Moscow.\nMilitarily, a counteroffensive by Western-backed Ukrainian forces resulted in seizing a significant chunk of territory back from the Russians. Diplomatically, meetings on the sidelines of theShanghai Cooperation Organisation summitlaid bare the limits of support for Russian actions from even its closest allies.\nIn thefirst in-person meetingbetween Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping after the invasion of Ukraine, the Chinese leader conveyed his misgivings over escalation of the crisis. Putin later acknowledged that “concerns and questions” were raised by the Chinese president.\nSimilarly, during Putin’s meeting with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi isreported to have voiced concernand convey that this was “not an era of war”.\nThe Ukraine crisis isn’t the only challenge to international peace and stability. The world is also being destabilised by the fallout from the US-China confrontation, which is a defining feature of the global landscape today.\nUnprecedented tensions between the two global powers have ensued in most part from America’s policy to contain China which is being met by an assertive response from Beijing.\nAt UNGA, President Joe Biden said he wanted to be “direct about the competition between the United States and China”. He said, “We do not seek conflict. We do not seek a Cold War. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner.” He also reaffirmed his country’s commitment to a ‘One China’ policy and promised the US would “conduct itself as a reasonable leader” in “managing shifting geopolitical trends”.\nCan a fractured global community transcend its divisions to deal purposefully with shared challenges?\nBut this measured tone on China has not been reflected in recent US actions. They include theannouncementof a billion-dollar arms package for Taiwan and fresh curbs on US exports of chip technology to Chinese companies. Both were roundly denounced by Beijing.\nAlso, just days before his UNGA address, Bidenreiteratedthat the US would defend Taiwan “militarily” if it was attacked. This too provoked a furious Chinese response.\nThe resurgence of East-West tensions and intensifying US-China confrontation have further shrunk the space for multilateral cooperation. But multilateralism has been in retreat for well over a decade and much before the Ukraine conflict.\nThe undermining of multilateralism emerged as a dominant trend in the last decade with the rise of hyper-nationalism and right-wing populism. Right-wing populist leaders have shown a propensity to act unilaterally in defiance of international law and norms.\nThis has been evidenced in our neighbourhood by the Modi government’s illegal annexation of occupied Jammu and Kashmir three years ago, and subsequent actions in blatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions.\nIt was also reflected in the contempt with which former president Donald Trump treated multilateral institutions, his ‘America first’ policy and renunciation of international treaties and agreements.\nThe pandemic saw a telling lack of global solidarity. The cooperation deficit on such shared challenges and other key areas further weakened multilateralism.\nTensions between big powers and the conduct of so-called regional ‘strongmen’ have contributed to a fractured global community and fragmentation of the international system. Indeed, a rules-based order is under unprecedented stress due to the qualified support of big powers. Geopolitics, not solidarity, is now the dominant dynamic.\nThe UN secretary general’s emphasis on the impact of climate change on vulnerable countries — with Pakistan as the case in point — and what to do about it represented a key part of his speech.\nLashing out at the West’s fossil fuels industry for making windfall profits, he called for these profits to be taxed and funds from them directed to afflicted countries to address losses caused to them by the climate crisis. Guterres squarely placed the issue of justice at the centre of the global debate on the climate crisis.\nHe pointed out that the G20 emits 80 per cent of all carbon emissions. On the other hand, Pakistan’s contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is under 1pc but it is the world’s seventh most vulnerable country to climate change and is reeling today from its ravages. That is why Pakistan is leading a developing country effort to establish a global fund to help states afflicted by climate-induced disasters.\nRead:Pakistan’s floods boost calls for compensation to poor nations\nWhether Western countries, long sceptical about this, can be persuaded to change their mind is unclear. But protesters across the world are now demanding climate justice, urging developed countries to compensate poorer states for the damage climate change is inflicting on them.\nFaced with a world in peril, the bigger question is whether developed states and big powers can transcend their divisions and rivalries to deal with shared challenges. In spite of Guterres’ clarion call to “act as one”, it is hard to be hopeful on that count."}]}

A video of Muslim students singing the bhajan circulated widely on social media, prompting fierce protests from Muslim organisations.\nThe Muttahida Majlis-i-Ulema, comprising 30 Kashmiri organisations, denounced the action and said it was designed to accelerate “the so-called integration of the younger generation with the Hindutva idea of India”. It called this part of efforts to erode the region’s Muslim identity.\nLed by Kashmiri leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who has been in detention for the past three years, the religious body pointed to attempts to “browbeat” Muslim scholars and undermine their role, citing the recent arrests of religious leaders in India’s latest intensification of repression.\nLast month, two ulema were arrested and several Islamic scholars charged under the draconian public safety act in a crackdown on Muslim groups in Kashmir. These arrests were roundlycondemnedby Pakistan. A Foreign Office statement described the illegal detention of Islamic scholars as “yet another Indian attempt to rob the Kashmiri people of their distinct religious and cultural identity”.\nThe BJP has also taken control of the J&K Waqf Board and thus all its properties across the region including Srinagar’s Eidgah, a historic ground for congregational prayers. Condemning this in a message from jail, Shabbir Shah, vice chair of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), accused the BJP government of infringing the religious rights of Muslims. Other Kashmiri leaders portrayed it as part of the BJP’s efforts to occupy prominent places of religious significance for Muslims throughout the occupied territory. This includes the control of shrines.\nAs a Kashmiri journalist told me, “Seizing control of shrines is not an innocuous move; it is a repressive action aimed at eliminating their political role as well as their Muslim identity.” He explained that shrines have been an integral part of Kashmir’s political and social landscape. “They have not only provided spaces for worship, but in a region under occupation for decades, they have often been the only places where Kashmiri Muslims could meet and confer. That space has now been taken away.”\nThe BJP has taken other steps in its onslaught against Kashmiri culture.\nFor the past 100 years or more, Urdu was the official language of J&K. But in 2020, India’s ruling party ended Urdu’s exclusive status by legislation that made Hindi, Kashmiri and Dogri official languages in J&K, in addition to Urdu and English. There are moves afoot to change the script of the Kashmiri language from Nastaliq to the Devanagriscript. Kashmiri sources in the occupied Valley say this has already been done unannounced and unofficially.\nThe BJP is trying to disempower Muslims and erode their religious and cultural identity in the occupied region.\nA series of actions to disempower Kashmiris and change the Muslim identity of Kashmir have followed India’sillegal annexationof J&K on Aug 5, 2019. With abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which gave the state special status, J&K was bifurcated and absorbed into the Indian Union. This was in blatant violation of UN Security Council Resolutions that bar the parties from bringing about any material change in the situation.\nRead:Why Kashmir matters\nDelhi then imposed a lockdown and communication clampdown and carried out mass arrests of political leaders and activists in a sweeping crackdown.\nAccording to the September 2022 briefing by Amnesty International, ‘We are being Punished by the Law’, in the three years since August 2019, “the Indian government has drastically intensified the repression of the people of J&K … by subjecting them to multiple human rights violations. These violations include restrictions on rights to freedom of opinion and expression; to liberty and security of person; to movement; to privacy; and to remedy and access to justice. The authorities have committed these violations with absolute impunity.”\nIn contravention of international law and UN resolutions, Delhi has carried out administrative and demographic changes to disempower Muslims in Kashmir. It introducednew domicile rulesand has, since August 2019, issued over 3.4 million so-called domicile certificates to non-Kashmiri outsiders, who were made eligible after abrogation of Article 370 and 35A of the Indian constitution. This action resembles Israel’s illegal settlement policies and is characteristic of tactics used by occupiers.\nThe Modi government also proceeded with a plan to gerrymander electoral constituencies to give Jammu greater representation to reduce Muslim representation and shift the political balance to Hindus in the region. The plan to carve out new constituencies was announced by India’s Delimitation Commission in May 2022. This gives Jammu six more seats in the 90-member J&K Assembly while Kashmir is to be given one more. This will take Jammu’s total seats to 43 leaving Kashmir with 47. The malign intent of this move is evident from the fact that Kashmir Valley’s population was close to seven million while Jammu’s population is 5.3m according to the 2011 census (the last India held). Estimates of Kashmir’s current population are obviously higher.\nThe aim behind this delimitation is to hold elections that the Modi government could then claim have ‘normalised’ the situation and ‘endorsed’ its August 2019 action. But this plan has met fierce resistance from Kashmiri leaders including traditionally pro-Indian politicians who in the past participated in elections, consistently boycotted by the APHC for being sham exercises. All have called the plan unacceptable and rejected it as a travesty of the principle of one man one vote. In July, the chief electoral officer in the occupied Valley announced granting voting rights to any Indian citizen, even temporary residents, in another attempt to change the region’s demography\nCan the Modi government achieve these sinister objectives? Can Kashmir’s Muslim identity be so easily obliterated by coercive measures and administrative diktats? These actions have in fact only intensified anger and resentment among the people of Kashmir and reinforced their will to resist the injustice of occupation. As Farooq Abdullah, former chief minister of J&K, warned not long ago “Kashmir could explode like a volcano”."}]}

Consider the recent verbal sparring between officials of the two countries. Last week, the Afghan deputy foreign ministeraccusedIslamabad of “receiving millions of dollars” from the US to permit American drones to fly over Pakistan’s airspace for operations in Afghanistan. This remark by Sher Abbas Stanekzai was evidently in response to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s UN General Assembly address, in which hesaidPakistan shared the concern of the international community about terrorist groups operating from Afghanistan’s soil. The Afghan minister’s allegation prompted a predictable retort from the Foreign Office spokesman who called it “unacceptable” and against the spirit of friendly relations between two neighbours.\nBut it wasn’t just this verbal clash between them that suggested uneasiness in relations. The violent activities of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan continue to be a source of concern and frustration for Islamabad. There has been a spike in cross-border terror attacks by TTP since the Taliban’s assumption of power. Official expectations that a Taliban government would help Pakistan secure and stabilise its western border have not been met. The TTP continues to be based in Afghanistan and conducts attacks from there. Over 155 Pakistani security personnel have lost their lives in these attacks in the past year.\nThe latest quarterly report of the UN Secretary General on Afghanistan, submitted to the Security Council in September, referred to“the continuing presence and activities of foreign groups in Afghanistan and its border areas“. It also said “border tensions and security incidents” have continued along the country’s border with Pakistan. An earlier report by the UNSC’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team found that “TTP has arguably benefited the most of all the foreign extremist groups in Afghanistan from the Taliban takeover” and “conducted numerous attacks and operations in Pakistan.” The May report also said that as a stand-alone force, TTP “is estimated to consist of 3,000 to 4,000 armed fighters located along the east and southeast Afghanistan-Pakistan border areas”.\nStable ties with Afghanistan are a strategic compulsion but many problems stand in the way.\nPakistani officials have engaged intalkswith the TTP in the hope that this would yield an agreement to end the armed group’s 14-year war on Pakistan. But talks broke down months ago when it became clear that an intransigent TTP’s demands were non-negotiable. They have not resumed since. Instead, Pakistan has had to undertake undeclared kinetic actions against TTP targets and figures in Afghanistan. This has involved the elimination of three top leaders of the militant group, according to informed sources. While this has provoked protests from Kabul, Pakistan is unlikely to cease such unannounced actions.\nThe country’s growing security concern is also focused on there-emergenceand concentration of the TTP in Swat. This seems to be an unintended consequence of permitting some members of the group to cross the border and resettle in the country under a misguided concession made to the TTP when talks were in progress. But the security situation in Swat, which has seen widespread anti-TTP protests by residents, has now obliged Pakistani law-enforcement agencies to take action against the militant organisation.\nBeyond security concerns, Pakistani officials are disappointed by the Taliban’s inability to live up to its other promises, especially girls’ education and respect for basic human rights. For the first time, top officials have been speaking out publicly on the denial of education to girls and continued closure of secondary girls’ schools by Taliban authorities. In an interview last month toFrance24, Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said the Taliban had not fulfilled their commitment on girls’ education. Significantly, Prime Minister Sharif said in his UN address that Pakistan was working to encourage Kabul to show respect for the rights of Afghan girls and women to education and work. In July, a resolution was adopted unanimously by the UN Human Rights Council that expressed unwavering commitment to the full and equal human rights for women and girls in Afghanistan, including the right to education and freedom of movement. Such calls by the international community and Pakistan have not elicited a positive response from the Taliban government. Explanations by Taliban leaders that they need time to move on this and on other ‘social concessions’ appear to be little more than excuses.\nThe international community’s patience is also wearing thin on this and other issues. The UN’s deputy head in Afghanistan, Markus Potzel,toldthe Security Council on Sept 27, that the international community is running out of patience on engagement with the Taliban. He acknowledged some “positive developments in the past few months”, but stressed “they have been too few and too slow and they are outweighed by negatives”. He portrayed the “ban on secondary education for girls — unique in the world — and growing restrictions on women’s rights” as “signals that the Taliban are indifferent to more than 50 per cent of the population and are willing to risk international isolation”. He said the Taliban’s claim of establishing peace and stability was also eroding given the rise in security incidents — armed clashes, crime and terrorist attacks. He added that “the reported presence of Al Qaeda leader Al-Zawahiri in the heart of Kabul and the strike against him, as well as continued presence of other terrorist groups, have forced a questioning of the Taliban’s counterterrorism commitments, further deepening the trust gap with the international community”.\nApart from these growing doubts over the utility of engagement, international interest in Afghanistan has also been waning. By relapsing into its regressive past and not responding to the concerns of the global community the Taliban have themselves contributed to diminishing interest in engagement. Infighting and power struggles among the Taliban is a key factor behind Kabul’s inability to embark on a course correction and is complicating and retarding decision-making.\nPakistani officials play down differences with Kabul and point to the many areas of ongoing cooperation to indicate that relations remain “smooth” and “good”. But it is also a fact that for months there have been no ministerial visits by either side. Cooperative relations with Afghanistan are a strategic compulsion for Pakistan but that does not minimise the many problems that stand in the way of achieving this."}]}

There is no doubt modern technology has been a force for good and responsible for innumerable positive developments — empowering people, improving lives, increasing productivity, advancing medical and scientific knowledge and transforming societies. Technological developments have helped to drive unprecedented social and economic progress. But the fourth industrial revolution has also involved the evolution of advance technologies that are creating disruption, new vulnerabilities and harmful repercussions, which are not fully understood, much less managed. A digitalised world is facing the challenge of cybersecurity as threats rise across the world. Data theft and fraud, cyberattacks and breaches of critical systems, electricity networks and financial markets are all part of rising risks.\nCommunication technology now dominates our lives like never before. It brings untold benefits but also presents new dangers. The phenomenon of fake news for example is not new. But its omnipresence today has much to do with digital technology, which has produced a proliferation of information channels and expansion of social media. Online platforms have become vehicles for the spread of misinformation. Fake news easily circulates due to the magnifying power of social media in a mostly unregulated environment. Anonymity in social media platforms gives trolls and purveyors of false stories the assurance they will not be held accountable for their lies or hate messages. So fake news is posted on social media without fear of retribution. ‘Deepfakes’ — doctored videos using artificial intelligence (AI) — are now commonly used to mislead and deceive.\nThe profit motive and business model of social media companies prevents them from instituting real checks on divisive and sensational content irrespective of whether it is true or false. That means ‘digital wildfires’ are rarely contained. Digital technology is also being abused to commit crimes, recruit terrorists and spread hate, all of which imperil societies. This presents challenges to social stability in what is now called the post-truth era.\nDigital technology is also fuelling polarisation and divisiveness within countries. Studies have pointed to its disruptive impact on political systems and democracy. In an article in theEuropean Journal of Futures Researchin March 2022, the authors wrote that “In times of scepticism and a marked dependence on different types of AI in a network full of bots, trolls, and fakes, unprecedented standards of polarisation and intolerance are intensifying and crystallising with the coming to power of leaders of dubious democratic reputation”. The connection between the rise of right-wing populist leaders and their cynical but effective deployment of social media is now well established.\nNew technologies present opportunities and dangers for nations and people.\nArtificial intelligence or machine intelligence presents many dangers such as invasion of privacy and compromise of multiple dimensions of security. The biggest threat posed by autonomous weapons systems is that they can take decisions and even strategies out of human hands. They can independently target and neutralise adversaries and operate without the benefit of human judgement or thoughtful calculation of risks. Today, AI is fuelling an arms race in lethal autonomous weapons in a new arena of superpower competition.\nRead:The PMO audio leaks — Could they be faked?\nThe book, co-authored by Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel Huttenlocher,The Age of AI: And our Human Future, lays bare the dangers ahead. AI has ushered in a new period of human consciousness, say the authors (Schmidt is Google’s former CEO), which “augers a revolution in human affairs”. But this, they argue, can lead to human beings losing the ability to reason, reflect and conceptualise. It could in fact “permanently change our relationship with reality”.\nTheir discussion of the military uses of AI and how it is used to fight wars is especially instructive. AI would enhance conventional, nuclear and cyber capabilities in ways that would make security relations between rival powers more problematic and conflicts harder to limit. The authors say that in the nuclear era, the goal of national security strategy was deterrence. This depended on a set of key assumptions — the adversary’s known capabilities, recognised doctrines and predictable responses. Their core argument about the destabilising nature of AI weapons and cyber capabilities is that their value and efficacy stems from their “opacity and deniability and in some cases their operation at the ambiguous borders of disinformation, intelligence collection and sabotage … creating strategies without acknowledged doctrines”. They see this as leading to calamitous outcomes. They note the race for AI dominance between China and the US, which other countries are likely to join. AI capabilities are challenging the traditional notion of security and this intelligent book emphasises that the injection of “nonhuman logic to military systems” can result in disaster.\nAdvanced new generation military technologies are a source of increasing concern because of their wide implications for international peace and stability. The remote-control war waged by US-led Western forces in Afghanistan over two decades involved the use of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones. This had serious consequences and resulted in thekillingof innocent people. The use of a cyberweapon — theStuxnet computer worm— by the US to target Iranian facilities in 2007 to degrade its nuclear programme was the first attack of its kind. More recently, Russian and Ukrainian militaries are using remotely operated aerial platforms in the Ukraine conflict. Reliance on technology can confront countries at war with unexpected problems. For example, frontline Ukrainian soldiers have faced outages of the internet satellite service which was supposed to prevent Russian forces from using that technology. This digital disruption is reported to have caused a crucial loss of communication between Ukraine’s military forces.\nDespite the risks and dangers of such new technologies, there is no international effort aimed at managing them much less regulating their use. There is no move by big powers for any dialogue on cyber and AI arms control. If the global internet can’t be regulated and giant, unaccountable social media companies continue to rake in excessive profits, there is even less prospect of mitigating the destabilising effects of cyber and AI-enabled military capabilities."}]}

The timing may have been coincidental. But it was telling that while President Xi was proclaiming China’s global power had increased, the US was resolving to deal with its “greatest geopolitical challenge” — China. Asserting that the post-Cold War era is over, the NSS said competition was now underway between the major powers to shape the future of the international order in the “decisive decade” ahead.\nThe US document affirmed that the country’s principal strategic goal was to prevail in the competition with China, the only nation with the economic, military, diplomatic and technological muscle to reshape the global order. To pursue this aim, it sought to strengthen coalitions it was building, through Nato, the AUKUS security partnership, the Quad, Five Eyes group as well as its Indo-Pacific policy. Russia needed to be constrained but the challenge it posed was different. While it constituted an immediate threat evidenced by the Ukraine war, it lacked China’s broad-spectrum capabilities.\nGiven the politically fractured and polarised state of the US today, the NSS acknowledged America needed to fix its damaged democracy to be able to compete abroad. Claiming the national security strategy had “broken down the dividing line between foreign and domestic policy”, it said internal shortcomings would have to be remedied. Apart from a challenged democracy, it mentioned the threat from “domestic violent extremists”, including those “motivated by racial or ethnic prejudice”. Building internal strength meant investment in innovation, infrastructure, industrial and technological progress.\nRead:Echoes of the Cold War\nThe theme of building domestic strength dominated President Xi’s address to the party congress. With development the top priority, his emphasis was on renewing “high-quality” economic growth by focusing on innovation and education and accelerating self-reliance in science and technology. But in urging preparedness to navigate “strong winds and high waves” and “danger in times of peace”, he called for stepped-up efforts to build a “world-class military”.\nDespite the tech war and tensions over Taiwan, economic decoupling is a distant possibility.\nThe goals marshalled out by the US and China are no surprise. Nor indeed their efforts to empower themselves for a more intense phase of competition that both agree is taking place in an unstable international environment. But in the near term, their stance on Taiwan might be the most consequential to their relationship and to international peace and security. President Xi’s pronouncements on the issue were unambiguous. Warning of “dangerous storms ahead”, he again drew a strategic red line in reiterating Beijing’s opposition to Taiwan’s independence. China sought peaceful reunification with Taiwan but it was for Beijing to decide its timing. He said China reserved the right to use force and other necessary measures but explained this message was “directed solely at interference by outside forces and the few separatists seeking Taiwan independence” and not the people of Taiwan.\nChina should be reassured by the reiteration of the One China policy in America’s NSS as well as the claim it does not support Taiwanese independence. But the document also says Washington would oppose any unilateral effort to change the status quo. Beijing can take little comfort in combative statements by President Biden and back-to-back provocative US actions. Beijing sees these as contradicting Washington’s other more reasonable pronouncements in deliberate erosion of its One China policy. Biden hassaidseveral times he would be prepared to use military force if Taiwan was attacked by China. Even Western analysts construe this as a reversal of what was long described as a policy of ‘strategic ambiguity’, which stopped short of committing to militarily defend Taiwan while voicing concern for the island’s security. Recently, Washington also announced a billion-dollararms packagefor Taiwan. This came on the heels of controversial visits by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Congresspersons to Taipei. They were denounced by Beijing, which conducted missile tests around the Taiwan strait in a show of force. The US Congress is now set to authorise $10 billion in military aid over five years for Taipei.\nWhile Taiwan represents the most dangerous arena of US-China confrontation, tensions are escalating on other fronts too. Washington is engaged in a battle to maintain supremacy in technology, where the NSS states the aim is to outpace China. Earlier this month, the US announcedwide-ranging measuresto bar American companies from exporting chips and advanced chip equipment to China in order to cripple its semiconductor industry, that manufactures chips and circuits needed in modern electronics ranging from supercomputers and smartphones to automobiles. Semiconductors are also a vital element in the development of artificial intelligence, in which US experts believe China currently has the edge. These restrictions were the latest in the ‘chip war’ and described as “the biggest shift in US policy” on tech exports to China since the 1990s. In response, Xi promised tech self-reliance in his address to the party congress.\nAmerican companies will also suffer by the US move. An important question is how far Washington is prepared to go in high-end technology decoupling and whether high-tech companies from other countries, none of whom were consulted, will follow these unilateral measures. This has far-reaching implications for countries across the world especially if decoupling results in a potentially disruptive bifurcation of the digital world.\nNone of this means the two global powers will not continue to be economically interdependent. China remains the largest source of imports for the US, which provides its people goods at low prices. It is also one of the largest markets for US manufactures and products. The trade war waged by the US against China by slapping higher tariffs on imports and China’s counter measures hasn’t changed that ineluctable reality. American companies benefit greatly from doing business in China. China also continues to own a substantial amount of US debt — around $1 trillion – in Treasury securities. This makes economic decoupling a distant possibility. But the question is whether this can act as a sufficient brake on tensions between the world’s two largest economies and urge them towards what Henry Kissinger calls “co-evolution” even as they engage in intense competition and a high-end tech war."}]}

The American ambassador in Islamabad was summoned to the Foreign Office for an explanation. In another rebuke to Washington, a statement issued after a meeting of the country’s top army generals, declared that as a responsible nuclear weapon state, Pakistan has taken all necessary measures to strengthen its nuclear security regime.\nAlthough the State Department tried to walk back Biden’s statement the verbal exchange between the two countries again focused attention on the future of Pakistan-US relations. The historically close relationship has been in flux following the American military withdrawal from Afghanistan last year after its ‘longest war’.\nFor two decades, the war provided the principal basis for engagement and cooperation between the two countries even as it became a source of mutual mistrust and disenchantment. But this marked only another episode in a mercurial, rollercoaster relationship, characterised by cyclical swings between intense engagement and deep estrangement.\nGeopolitical concerns that shaped America’s regional alignments and priorities also defined relations with Pakistan. They drove bilateral ties into different phases. First, in the Cold War, when the US aim was to contain communism, Pakistan became America’s ‘most allied ally’. Then came the pressing need, after 1979, of rolling back the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. And then the post-9/11 phase that involved defeating Al Qaeda in the ‘war on terror’. That chapter ended with theUS exit from Afghanistan. These phases laid bare an ineluctable reality. Positive transformations in ties were almost always driven by events extraneous to the bilateral relationship.\nEven before the US pullout from Afghanistan, geopolitical dynamics were shifting fundamentally as China stepped up its diplomatic and economic engagement and launched its Belt and Road Initiative. Regional states including Pakistan began to sense a waning of both American interest and influence.\nRead more:US cannot walk away from Pakistan: report\nFormer president Donald Trump’s‘America First’ foreign policysignalled gradual disengagement from the region. This coincided with a significant intensifying of Pakistan’s longstanding strategic ties with China. They were symbolised by its pivotal role in BRI and the accompanying substantial Chinese investment in Pakistan’s infrastructure, energy and development projects.\nIncreasingly, America was seen as a self-absorbed and inconsistent partner as well as a reluctant regional player. China was perceived as having the interest, money and growing global clout needed for a more constructive and enduring relationship.\nAlthough China is Pakistan’s strategic priority, Islamabad also wants an improved and stable relationship with America. The US remains Pakistan’s largest export destination, a source of FDI and a global power with significant influence, especially over international financial institutions, whose assistance Pakistan’s crisis-ridden economy continues to desperately need. Pakistan wants to avoid getting into the crosshairs of American-Chinese confrontation, but that is easier said than done.\nPakistan-US relations are at an inflection point today. Any significant reset of ties will be influenced by a number of key factors. The most important is America’s policy of containing China and pursuit of a strategy to mobilise countries to join it to counterbalance Beijing’s rising global power. The revitalisation of Quad, the AUKUS security partnership and its Indo-Pacific strategy are all part of efforts to cement an anti-China coalition.\nThis confrontation has obvious implications for Pakistan-US relations. So long as US-China relations remain rocky it will have a bearing on Pakistan’s effort to reshape ties with Washington. Islamabad may want to balance ties between the US and China but it cannot be part of any anti-China coalition or strategy. That limits the space for expanding ties when Washington’s overriding goal today is to counter China’s increasing global power while Islamabad sees its strategic future to lie with China.\nAnother complicating factor is Washington’s growing strategic and economic relations with India, its partner of choice in the region in its strategy to project India, a member of Quad, as a counterweight to China. The implications for Pakistan of the US-India entente are evident from Washington turning a blind eye to India’sillegal annexationof occupied Jammu and Kashmir and its continuing silence over the grim situation there.\nMoreover, US strengthening of India’s military and strategic capabilities is intensifying the regional imbalance magnifying Pakistan’s security challenge. This in turn is driving Pakistan to enhance its strategic capabilities. This is a compulsion, because while Washington continues to arm India in its counter China policy, 70 per cent of India’s military assets — land, air and sea — remain deployed against Pakistan.\nAspects of America’s Indo-Pacific strategy also have security implications for Pakistan, especially as the US has extended the contest with China in the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean, thus injecting Cold War-type dynamics there. Opposed to India’s domination of the Indian Ocean, Islamabad has long sought to prevent it from becoming India’s Ocean. With the Indian Ocean now an arena of geostrategic contest this has obliged Pakistan to increase its military presence and strengthen its capabilities there.\nThe challenge then is for the two countries to find space between the Pakistan-China strategic relationship and the US-India partnership to rebuild ties on a mutually beneficial basis. There certainly is space and areas of cooperation for them to explore in order to reset ties.\nThe recent US decision to go ahead with thesale of sparesfor Pakistan’s F-16 fleet despite Indian opposition illustrates this. For its part, Islamabad seeks a new basis for relations predicated on Pakistan’s intrinsic importance and not as a subset of ties with a third country. Its vision is of broad-based relations that move beyond the traditional focus of security to economic, trade and investment ties and cooperation in science, technology and education.\nThe US too has affirmed in recent statements that it wants strengthened and constructive ties with Pakistan. But more than declarations of intent it will need imagination by both sides to identify where their interests converge in order to reconfigure ties on a durable basis."}]}

Such violence is condemnable and unacceptable. It should have no place in the country whose tortuous history has seen assassinations of political leaders in the past.\nThetragic assassinationof Benazir Bhutto is still painfully fresh in the nation’s collective memory. But the attack on Khan last week also confirmed the worst fears of those who had been sounding an alarm about the increasingly explosive political situation descending into violence. Khan had frequently spoken about a threat to his life but carried on with his long march to press the demand for immediate elections.\nAfter last week’s shooting tempers of angry PTI supporters have been rising to a fever pitch. Protests broke out in many cities. In his first press conference since being shot, Imran Khan called for the resignation of the prime minister, federal interior minister and a senior intelligence official, accusing them of plotting to murder him.\nHe offered no evidence but called for public protests until this demand was accepted. He also said the long march would resume once he recovered. Khan’s allegations prompted a strong response from ISPR, which emphaticallyrejected his “baseless and irresponsible” accusationsagainst the army.\nMeanwhile, speculation continues to run rife about who was behind the attack on Khan’s convoy and who would benefit from it. Few believe the attack was carried out by a lone assailant. PTI leaders insist there was more than one gunman.\nCompounding the mystery was the prompt confessional video of the assailant released by Wazirabad’s local police. In a polarised environment, partisanship has been dictating the response to the murderous attempt with conspiracy theories running rampant. The Punjab government has made matters worse by its inept handling of the incident.\nUnless there is political calm it would be difficult to get to the bottom of what happened in an impartial way. Accusations before an investigation has taken place will only hinder and muddy the waters in the search for the truth. Both the government and opposition need to bring down the political temperature so that a credible and transparent investigation can get underway.\nNever before did the country have to confront so many serious challenges in such a divided and fractured state.\nThe initial outpouring of nationwide sympathy for the former prime minister including from his political foes held out the hope, albeit fleetingly, that the atmosphere would become less charged. But it didn’t take long for both sides to engage in fierce verbal clashes that quickly vitiated the atmosphere.\nRemarksby the federal interior minister further added fuel to the fire. Both sides accused each other of crossing ‘red lines’ and ‘politicising’ the assassination attempt. The political discourse lurched between those blaming the victim for ignoring security requirements and others holding coalition government leaders responsible.\nThe tragic incident has left the country even more divided. It has compounded the seven-month-old political crisis, making its resolution even more problematic. With PTI calling for countrywide protests and ‘revenge’ political turbulence is expected to continue. This at a time when even before the attempt on Khan’s life, the country was reeling from multiple, overlapping crises — political, economic, institutional — as well as the challenge of recovering from the worst climate-induced floods the country has seen. Never before has Pakistan needed to navigate these serious challenges in such a divided and fractured state.\nMost significantly, intensifying political polarisation will serve as an impediment to the country’s ability to deal with a bigger challenge — a deeply troubled economy. The uncertainty generated by political unrest and turmoil is pushing the country to the edge of the economic precipice.\nFar from being out of the woods the economy faces solvency challenges ahead. Despite the revival of theIMF programme, cash injections from friendly countries and other international financial institutions and assistance for floods, the country’s needs are enormous to finance the current account deficit and meet external debt obligations.\nForeign exchange reserves are at a three-year low, enough to cover just six weeks of imports. Two rating agencies,Moody’s and Fitch, havedowngradedPakistan’s credit rating. The economic damage from floods, estimated at over $30 billion, has exacerbated the country’s financial difficulties. So has the economic fallout of the Ukraine war in the shape of soaring oil and food prices and the prospect of major LNG shortages in the coming winter months.\nThe market has been nervous over the billion-dollar sovereign bond payment due in December. The bond has been trading at a huge discount. The government insists it has lined up adequate finances to pay this and meet the heavy external obligations ahead.\nIts confidence may be based on expectations that it would secure debt rollovers and more assistance from bilateral creditors and that volatility in global energy markets will ease. The government claims it will get additional — and substantial — financial help from Saudi Arabia and China this fiscal year. But here lies the problem.\nWhile Pakistan has faced repeated balance-of-payments and liquidity crises in the past, today it has to deal with this in an adverse external environment in which the aftershocks of the Covid pandemic and fallout of the Ukraine conflict have left supply chains and global commodity and financial markets in an unsettled state.\nThe impact of unpredictability on the country’s perilous external position when its foreign exchange reserve cushion is eroding cannot be underestimated. Uncertainty is putting pressure on the exchange rate with a weak rupee fuelling inflation, which continues to be stubbornly high.\nMoreover, prospects of an economic recovery depend critically on the level of private investment, which is the most important indicator of the country’s growth path and sustainable financial stability. But investors remain hesitant due to heightened political uncertainty. Anticipation of more political unrest is dampening investor sentiment and reinforcing their instinct to sit it out. It is also making markets edgy.\nIf current political troubles continue with no end in sight, it will exact an even heavier toll on a struggling economy, increase people’s economic hardship and leave the country in a more ungovernable state — regardless of cash help from friendly nations. Living on loans from outside will not fix Pakistan’s internal problems."}]}

Amid intensifying polarisation and heightened tensions, political disputes are no longer amenable to resolution by political means. Political rivals either resort to the courts or appeal to the army to promote their objectives.\nIt was telling that the then chief justice of the Islamabad High Court Athar Minallah urged political leaders,during a full court referencelast week, not to bring their conflicts to the courts and instead strengthen parliament by resolving these issues in a democratic forum.\nPrudent advice. But parliament today is a forlorn place with Imran Khan’s PTI staying out and coalition government parties mostly talking to themselves in the National Assembly. That too when a quorum can be ensured there. The absence of the opposition in the Lower House makes it all but dysfunctional.\nBut it is the lack of communication between the coalition government and the opposition — except through bitter and inflammatory exchanges on television — that rules out political resolution of their differences.\nThis gridlock is undermining the political system by marginalising parliament and of course driving politics onto the street. It also poses a threat to democracy. When politics fails and searing divides make it impossible for the political impasse to be overcome, democracy cannot function. The shell of democracy remains but it is then shorn of substance.\nThis has pushed the country on to uncharted territory especially with opposition-run provinces pitted against the centre. The political confrontation between the PTI and the federal government is now driving the top echelons of Punjab’s administrative and police system into a state of disorder.\nIt has left thecountry’s largest provincewithout a full-time chief secretary and an inspector general of police who has expressed his reluctance to serve there while the political wrangle over him continues.\nThe drama overfiling an FIRof the armed attack on Khan only underlined how chaotic the system has become. In fact, the Punjab government is in a state of virtual paralysis. It continues to make a lot of noise but fails to govern.\nInstead, the provincial government has extended administrative support to the opposition’s long march, an unedifying example of a government engaging in disruptive and agitational politics. The province-centre tussle is increasingly taking an ugly turn.\nThe raging political crisis has brought institutions under unprecedented pressure. The superior courts are now expected not just to adjudicate on legal and constitutional issues but also decide matters ranging from allowing the opposition’s long march, stopping it, where a protest demonstration should be held in the capital and how to keep major roads open.\nRead more:Army sends out big guns to plead its case\nThis is turning the courts into arbiters of politics, rather than arbiters of law, which is their fundamental role. On issues such as the attempted assassination of Khan and the mysterious murder of journalist Arshad Sharif, the chief justice of the Supreme Court has also been urged by the federal government to constitute judicial commissions for probes that should arguably be undertaken by other institutions.\nBut as public confidence is low in the capability of these institutions to conduct impartial investigations, the pressure comes on the apex court. This places courts in the cross hairs of political storms. This of course is not new.\nThe country has a long history of courts mediating in constitutional disputes which is what they are supposed to do. They have also mediated political disputes in times of crisis dealing with matters that ostensibly have constitutional implications. But the frequency with which warring political sides are now resorting to the higher judiciary is placing an unprecedented burden on them.\nIt was therefore no surprise that Supreme Court Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial recently reminded petitioners that the courtcannot assume the role of the executive branch of government even if the suo motu jurisdiction empowered it to look into issues involving the breach of fundamental rights.\nThe showdown may be nearing a climactic point but its outcome is hard to predict.\nMeanwhile Imran Khan’s azadi march hasresumed, which has been preceded and accompanied by PTI protests and road blockades that have disrupted life in several cities. His provocative statements about the establishment have served to up the ante on the military leadership to force their hand.\nWhile hurling allegations against the army — even accusing a senior army officer of complicity in a plot to assassinate him — he is, at the same time, seeking the army’s support to help meet his demand for immediate elections and remove the coalition government.\nIn essence, Khan’s criticism of the establishment isn’t that it wields too much political influence but that it is no longer willing to back him. That is why he keeps taunting the military for its ‘neutrality’. Far from opposing military intervention in politics, he appears to want the army to intervene on his behalf.\nExclusive:Imran's candid take on 'bad romance' with military\nThe danger now looms of the tense situation snowballing into civil strife. The showdown between the government and opposition may be nearing a climactic point but its outcome is hard to predict. In view of this, many believe that calling elections sooner rather than later can avert what appears to be certain political chaos ahead.\nA recent survey by the Institute of Public Opinion Research showed that a large majority of respondents, 63 per cent, support immediate elections and only 29pc want the present assemblies and the coalition government to complete their term. Significantly, and perhaps paradoxically, over half of those surveyed want his party to return to the National Assembly to achieve its political objectives. A significant majority of respondents, 59pc, do not support Imran Khan’s long march.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif afterconsultationswith Mian Nawaz Sharif in London announced that his government will not accede to the demand for early elections. With neither side prepared to back down, the battle lines are sharply drawn, making the situation untenable. That only portends more escalation in political tensions with increasingly uncertain consequences for both a fragile democracy and a shaky economy."}]}

The conflict in Ukraine and US-China tensions both cast a shadow over the annual meeting of the Group of 20 countries in Bali. President Vladimir Putin didn’t attend the summit, where Russia’s aggression against Ukraine loomed large on the agenda.\nGeopolitical tensions unleashed by the conflict as well as its far-reaching fallout on the global economy, including disruption of supply chains and soaring energy and food prices, were top concerns at the summit. Geopolitics dominated the gathering of the world’s largest economies.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the summit by video, making anemphatic callfor Russia to withdraw its troops and end the war, but rejecting peace proposals that would erode his country’s “sovereignty, territory and independence”.\nThe joint statementissuedat the close of the summit declared that “today’s era must not be of war” and that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons was “inadmissible” — a reference to Putin’s threat to resort to the nuclear option if the Ukraine crisis escalated. The statement sent an important message to Moscow.\nBut it was themeetingbetween President Jo Biden and President Xi Jinping on the eve of the summit that was more consequential for international stability, as it indicated a deceleration of tensions between the two global powers. The opening statements by both leaders set a positive tone in their first face-to-face meeting since Biden assumed the presidency. Both pledged to improve relations, which had sunk to a historic low in recent years, raising concerns across the world about the advent of a new Cold War.\nXi told Biden that the world is at an inflection point, which obliged their countries to chart the right course for the relationship and “elevate” it. The present state of China-US relations, he asserted, was not in the fundamental interests of the two countries and needed to be on a ‘healthy and stable track”. Biden said it was “critical” for the two to work together on urgent and global issues.\nHe later told a press conference that he was not looking for a conflict and that US-China competition had to be managed “responsibly” to avoid a new Cold War.\nRead more:Kamala Harris meets Xi briefly, calls for US-China communication\nBoth leaders came to this meeting strengthened in their respective positions — Xi after securing an unprecedented third term in power, and Biden after an unexpectedly strong electoral performance by the Democratic Party, which retained control of the Senate in midterm Congressional elections. Both leaders have known each other long before they reached the helm of their respective country.\nThat personal factor may have contributed to good atmospherics for the meeting. One outcome of their three-hour-long parleys was agreement to increase communication between their countries and “empower key senior officials” to engage on global issues such as food security and climate change.\nThe Biden-Xi meeting on the summit sidelines marked a serious effort to stabilise their turbulent relations.\nThis did not, of course, mean their differences narrowed over the contentious issues and disputes that divide them — Taiwan, trade disputes, technology curbs and military postures. Indeed, both sides once again spelt out their respective red lines on Taiwan. Although Biden reiterated the US commitment to a One China policy, he sounded a warning over what he described as China’s coercive posture on Taiwan, which he claimed posed a threat to stability in the region.\nPresident Xi, for his part, welcomed Biden’s assurance that Washington did not support Taiwanese independence, but made it clear that Taiwan was a core interest for China and “the first red line” which “must not be crossed in China-US relations”. Before their meeting, a spokesman of the Chinese foreign ministry, in a tough statement, called on the US to “stop fudging, distorting and hollowing out the One China principle [and] strictly abide by the basic norms of international relations”.\nEditorial:Xi-Biden summit\nFor Asia-Pacific countries, as indeed for much of the world, the tentative bid to stabilise US-China relations was a welcome development as few, if any, of them want be caught in the cross hairs of a dangerous confrontation.\nA top American official acknowledged the risk of unmanaged competition descending into conflict was of concern to US allies and partners in the region. For a global economy in turmoil and struggling with record inflation, an easing of US-China tensions is necessary to counter the blows from the Ukraine conflict and the trade/tech war between the two superpowers.\nThe host of the summit, Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo, stated clearly that “G20 must be the catalyst for inclusive economic recovery … [and] not divide the world into parts. We must not allow the world to fall into another Cold War”. He urged concrete action and collaborationto heal the ailing global economy at a summit whosetheme was ‘Recover together, recover stronger’.\nThe declaration issued by G20 leaders said the world economy was facing “unparalleled multidimensional crises”, and called for steps to curb inflation, protect the vulnerable, calibrate monetary tightening and avoid high currency volatility. But no plan for global recovery was agreed because the economic interests of its members are so varied.\nIn fact, differences among G20 nations, especially on the war in Ukraine, were laid bare in the leaders’ statement issued after the summit. Recognising that the G20 is “not the forum to resolve security issues”, the 17-page document acknowledged that “there were other views and different assessments of the [Ukraine] situation and sanctions” even as “most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine”.\nNevertheless,Russia’s aggression against Ukrainewas denounced in the “strongest of terms”, which it said was damaging the global economy, especially by fuelling inflation and exacerbating energy and food shortages across the world.\nWhile many Western commentators saw the most important outcome of the G20 summit to be Putin’s increasing international isolation, the global gathering may well be remembered more for the Biden-Xi meeting on the sidelines, which opened an opportunity to improve US-China relations and move the two global powers toward ‘responsible competition’."}]}

The impression this created was as if the entire destiny of the country depended on who made it to the army’s top slot.\nThis is not to say such appointments are inconsequential in a country that has seen repeated military interventions in politics and where the army continues to wield much influence and power. But the obsessive concern with the change of guard at GHQ made it appear as if this is the defining factor that will decide the country’s direction in the years ahead. This distracts attention from the issues that will really determine Pakistan’s fate and destiny.\nIt is how a confluence of challenges confronting the country are addressed that will shape the country’s future. The challenges are well known and so are their solutions. But it is for the political leadership to accord them priority and deal with them resolutely and consistently.\nThe most important challenges include a deeply polarised and fractured polity and problems of financial solvency, a stagnant economy, persisting education deficit and demographic dynamics characterised by a youth bulge.\nThe complex and serious nature of these interconnected challenges means that no single political party can deal with them on its own. This should urge political leaders to transcend partisan interests and forge agreement on core issues even as their political competition continues.\nBut divisive politics and hyper partisanship prevents sustained focus on the country’s problems, much less on evolving minimal consensus to resolve them. Heightened tensions, stand-off between the centre and opposition-controlled provinces and confrontational politics have created a fraught environment inimical to dealing with the country’s challenges. Deceleration of tensions is needed and a cooling-off period so that a degree of political stability is established.\n\nAgreement between the government and opposition on a time frame for elections might help to achieve this, in which both sides concede on their maximum position to find a middle ground solution. This could bring down the political temperature and create a calmer environment necessary for peaceful and orderly polls.\nBut if the current political turbulence continues, uncertainty will inevitably have a negative impact on efforts to heal a deeply ailing economy. Economic recovery and finding a sustainable path to growth is by far the most consequential issue for the country.\n\nStaying on track with the IMF programme is crucial as that enables Pakistan to access financial resources to meet its heavy external obligations. Around $34 billion is needed this fiscal year to finance the current account deficit and make debt repayments. Public debt is at a record high with the total foreign debt at $127bn. Reserves have fallen to $7.8bn, which cover just five weeks of imports. The rupee’s slide continues against the dollar. Concerns about a sovereign default persist, despite emphatic denials by federal ministers who have repeatedly maintained such alarmist views are mistaken.\nIt is how the confluence of challenges are tackled that will determine the country’s fate and fortunes.\nManaging deteriorating public finances is urgent especially in the face of a volatile and unfavourable global economic environment. But stabilisation measures are necessary, not sufficient to put the economy on a sustainable path.\n\nBeyond the IMF programme, rollover of loans by foreign creditors and more borrowing, a credible economic strategy is needed that charts a path to growth. The country needs a comprehensive plan and reforms to fix structural problems to end the vicious cycle of high budget/ balance-of-payments deficits and chronic foreign exchange crises that have led to repeated IMF bailouts.\nPakistan is now in its 23rd IMF programme. Unless structural issues are tackled the country will not escape from the trap of slow growth, low savings and investment, high deficits, heavy borrowing, growing indebtedness and soaring inflation.\nEconomic growth and sustainable recovery will only be ensured if there is an appreciable rise in private investment. This requires an environment and policies that build and sustain investor confidence. A single, liberal business regulatory framework for the country and commitment to policy continuity by political leaders can help foster an enabling climate. Conversely, uncertainty and political turmoil will keep investors in a hesitant state and undermine investment prospects.\nAlso consequential to the country’s future is the coverage and quality of education offered to its children. Economic progress cannot be achieved without a solid educational base. That is what makes the difference between success or failure of economic development. This requires long-term policy decisions. Yet successive federal governments have washed their hands off education using the pretext of the 18th Constitutional Amendment, which devolved education (other than higher education) to the provinces, while provincial governments accorded it little priority.\nDecades of neglect and chronic underspending on education have left Pakistan with 22.8 million children out of school and earned the country the dubious distinction of having the world’s second highest number of children out of school. Exacerbating this grim situation are high school dropout rates and gender gaps. This has serious ramifications in view of Pakistan’s demographic profile, because unless the scale and quality of education is expanded, young people with no education or skills will face a jobless and hopeless future and a life of poverty. Rather than treat this as a national emergency, the education deficit has been wilfully ignored.\nSimilarly, the population time bomb that is ticking away barely figures in official priorities. The annual growth rate of two per cent is among the region’s highest. The demographic structure, with youth comprising 64pc of the population under 30, means almost 4m young people enter the working age population every year. This needs over a million jobs to be created annually. The combination of demographics, the education gap and a stagnant economy risks social instability in the years to come.\nThese fundamental issues, among others, will determine Pakistan’s fate and fortunes. It is the choices our political leaders make in the months and years ahead that will decide the country’s destiny — not who has been appointed army chief."}]}

Political tensions show no sign of abating. Political leaders often claim the next round of battle will be decisive but their war rages on. The war paradigm guides their political behaviour. Opponents are seen as enemies, not competitors. Politics is about vanquishing the enemy and eliminating them from the political scene in a terminal conflict.\nThis of course is not new. This pattern of behaviour has resonated throughout Pakistan’s history and is part of an unedifying political tradition characterised by intolerance and lack of respect for democratic norms.\nThose in power have rarely accepted the need to engage with the opposition, while those in opposition have often sought to destabilise the government of the day. There have been moments of rare cooperation, as for example, in the consensus that led to adoption of the 18th Constitutional Amendment. But for the most part, Pakistan’s fractious politics has seen fierce government-opposition conflict and mutual efforts to upend each other.\nThese endless political feuds opened space for the military’s manipulation of politics and frequent return to the political stage.\n\nThere was another cost to the country. The lack of a stable and predictable environment proved a huge hurdle to solving the country’s daunting problems, which were either left to fester or met by imprudent short-term policy responses. Pakistan’s economic troubles are in no small measure a consequence of this.\nSince 2008, the country has seen a period of uninterrupted civilian rule, despite the so-called ‘hybrid experiment’ of recent years that gave the army an informal but extensive role in national affairs. This period should nonetheless have involved a strengthening of democracy. It should have seen efforts by political parties to create a democratic culture. But this didn’t happen.\nAn opportunity was also lost to rebalance and reset power among state institutions as well as realign politics with the economic and social changes sweeping the country. These changes included greater urbanisation, expansion of a more assertive middle class, emergence of a diverse and vibrant civil society and a more ‘connected’ and informed citizenry, thanks to the spread of technology.\nInstead of a new form of politics emerging, it remained in a mostly old mould.\nThe rise of PTI, which came to represent the aspirations of the middle class and youth and also tapped into public resentment against the elite, promised a departure from politics-as-usual. But it became a cult following rather than a modern political party that could act ‘independently’ of its establishment benefactors once it assumed power. Like other parties it included members of the old political elite, local influentials and habitual turncoats — prominent figures who were previously part of the two traditional parties that the PTI condemned as corrupt and bankrupt. Expediency denuded it from the chance to chart a new political course for the country. The primacy of personality over party organisation also made the new party resemble older ones.\nBereft of ideas intra-elite conflict offers no escape from the quagmire Pakistan is trapped in.\nAs a result, there has been little break from the past in the way politics functions, the narrow social base of party leaders and what status quo-oriented parties have to offer the public in whose name they play the power game.\nIt also means there is no significant change in the relationship between the state and citizens, despite the transformed social and political environment. Politics remains a competition between and among political elites. It is sadly bereft of ideas or a vision — other than platitudes — about where opposing parties want to take the country. There are barely any significant policy differences between rival parties who nonetheless declare each other unfit to govern.\nPakistan’s disappointing economic record illustrates this.\nGovernments, even when run by different political parties, have adopted a similar economic stance, despite their claims to the contrary. Rather than undertake reform and raise domestic resources to address the country’s widening budget and balance of payments deficits, they all resorted to excessive borrowing.\nThe availability of external resources as a result of Pakistan’s foreign policy alignments during the Cold War and beyond created a habit of dependence on ‘outside help’. This habit urged successive governments — representing rural and urban elites — to avoid economic reform, mobilise adequate revenue or tax its network of influential supporters. Aid-fuelled or ‘borrowed’ economic growth may not necessarily have been a bad thing if the fiscal space it provided was used to launch reforms to solve the underlying structural problems of the economy: broadening the tax net, documenting the economy, diversifying the export base, and encouraging savings to finance a level of investment that could sustain an economic growth rate higher than the rise in population. But none of this happened. The availability of external resources along with high levels of remittances from overseas Pakistanis simply enabled ruling elites to paper over the structural problems of the economy. Every government sought IMF bailouts to avert insolvency.\n\nEconomic management that relied on someone else’s money permitted the country’s rulers — both civilian and military — to postpone much-needed structural reforms, including tax reform, that could have placed the economy on a viable, self-sustaining path. Successive governments borrowed heavily to finance development as well as consumption. In the process, the country accumulated unsustainable debt both by borrowing abroad and at home. This burden continues to cripple the economy today and fuel record levels of inflation.\nWith few if any exceptions, governments formed by different political parties preferred to pursue ‘pain-free’ ways to manage public finances. This has left the country lurching from one financial crisis to another. While playing to populist constituencies their policies perpetuated the status quo.\nThis can be only explained in terms of a political elite or ‘privilegentsia’ averse to measures it saw as eroding its political position or undermining its class interests. Their economic policies testify that elite capture of public resources is an abiding reality.\nThis intra-elite conflict is hardly obscured by the highfalutin rhetoric which it is wrapped in. Its most troubling aspect is that it offers no escape from the quagmire the country is trapped in — of dysfunctional politics, mounting governance challenges, visionless economic management and crumbling public faith in state institutions."}]}

Looking ahead at key geopolitical trends and challenges in 2023, their overarching aspect is uncertainty and unpredictability. This at a time of power shifts in an increasingly fragmented international system with multilateralism under growing stress. Rising geopolitical tensions and global economic volatility are keeping the world in an unstable state.\nThe most significant strategic dynamic in the year ahead will be the course of relations between global powers. The disruptive economic repercussions of war in Ukraine will blight prospects of global economic recovery and is already compounding a cost-of-living triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.\nMost annual assessments of key global trends in the year ahead by international think tanks, investment firms and others see unpredictability as the ‘new normal’.\nThe Economist’s ‘The World Ahead 2023’reportsuccinctly describes the world today as being “much more unstable, convulsed by the vicissitudes of great-power rivalry, the aftershocks of the pandemic, economic upheaval, extreme weather, and rapid social and technological change”.\nThe principal geopolitical risk that will dominate the coming year is intensifying competition between the US and China and its ramifications for global geopolitics and economy. Thefirst in-person meetingbetween Presidents Jo Biden and Xi Jinping in November did promise de-escalation of tensions.\nBoth leaders pledged to improve relations that had sunk to a historic low, raising international concerns about the advent of a new Cold War. But their meeting did not narrow differences between them on the contentious issues that divide them — Taiwan, trade disputes, technology curbs and military postures.\nThe outlook is uncertain, especially as Washington’s policy of containing China, reaffirmed in the Biden administration’s national security strategy, and an assertive Chinese pushback, will keep relations on a tense track. Tech de-coupling will accelerate, military competition will intensify and Taiwan will remain a dangerous flashpoint in relations.\n\nControl Risks, a global consulting firm, sees the US-China relationship as the greatest geopolitical risk in 2023. Other assessments rule out conflict. But Southeast Asian countries worry about an accidental clash in the fraught Asia-Pacific region — the strategic theatre of the US-China stand-off.\nThe course of the Ukraine war is another critical area to watch in the coming year. Russia’sinvasion of Ukrainemarks a geopolitical fault line, which the annual Strategic Survey by the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies says has political and economic consequences that are reshaping the global landscape.\nThe IISSsurveyargues the “war is redefining Western security, may change Russia profoundly, and is influencing perceptions and calculations globally”. Although the conflict shifted the West’s attention from its strategic priority in the Asia Pacific, it underlined that Europe’s security remained the West’s ‘core interest’.\nThe Survey argues the two theatres — Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific — are mutually dependent as the first arena’s “fracture would make any more external security commitments unviable” while its “successful defence would lend credibility to any Indo-Pacific tilt”. Whether or not one agrees with this, there is little doubt that if a negotiated end to the war is not achieved and continues to be stalemated it will destabilise the world beyond Europe.\nThe year ahead will see rising geopolitical tensions and nations struggle with economic challenges.\nNothing illustrates this more starkly than the war’s economic fallout. Its disruptive impact has thrown global supply chains and commodity and energy markets into chaos, with volatility contributing to recessionary pressures in major economies and beyond.\nThe conflict has given rise to soaring food prices and intensified global inflation. Dealing with these challenges will consume most nations’ energies in the coming year but will hit poorer, debt-burdened economies especially hard. Food insecurity will be a key challenge in 2023, while the energy crisis will test global financial stability.\n\nFitch rating companydescribesthe present economic phase as “arguably the most economically disruptive period since World War II” due to the outcome of three shocks — the global trade war, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Ukraine conflict. In October, the IMFwarnedthe worst is yet to come for the global economy and many countries will see a recession in 2023.\nThe US-China rivalry, Ukraine war and global power shifts have already led to new formal alignments and reinvigorated previous alliances. Examples include Quad and AUKUS — part of America’s Indo-Pacific strategy to counter China’s rising power.\nChina’s use of geo-economic strategies by its Belt and Road enterprise, that has enhanced its influence across the world, is expected to accelerate. Newer alignments are also indicated by growing China-Saudi Arabia ties.\nIn the prevailing geopolitical environment, nations will pursue hedging strategies to protect their interests and buffet them from the headwinds of big power rivalries. Another emerging trend also reflects how countries may respond to a more multipolar world — seeking issue-based ‘alignments’ with likeminded countries or joining ad hoc coalitions on specific issues.\nWhat kind of world order will emerge from all this remains an unresolved question because the international system is at present so fractured. Ian Bremmer, head of the political risk firm EuroAsia Group, makes a compelling argument that “Tomorrow’s geopolitics will be based not on a single global order, but on multiple coexisting orders, with different actors providing leadership to manage different kinds of challenges”.\nIn a speech about where the world is headed in 2023, he said the global security order would be US-led, global economic order will depend on China’s trajectory, the global digital order would be driven by giant tech companies while the global climate order is already “multipolar and multi-stakeholder”.\n2023 will see continuing challenges to democracy. This has international implications. When polarisation and searing divides make democracy dysfunctional, which is happening in many countries, domestic weakness affects their foreign policy conduct and ability to act effectively in the global arena.\nRight-wing populist leaders who display intolerance and violate democratic norms at home also tend to pursue disruptive policies abroad that undermine multilateralism.\nThe coming year will see a world of geopolitical tensions, economic insecurity and multiple other challenges including climate change that will test the resilience of nations as well as the international community’s ability to take collective action on shared problems."}]}

On Dec 11, aborder clash between Afghan and Pakistani border forcesin Chaman claimed the lives of at least eight Pakistani citizens.\nThe clash and asubsequent one on Dec 15reflected an uptick in border tensions in recent months. This has often led to closure of the border crossing. Many incidents have been triggered by Afghan forces’ resistance to stronger border controls recently imposed by Pakistan through documentation and biometric requirements at all five border crossings between the two countries.\nTaliban authorities have voiced their reservations about these. Some incidents have followed disputes over the border fence erected by Pakistan along much of the frontier.\nThe clash earlier this month prompted asharp response from ISPR, which called the “unprovoked and indiscriminate fire” from the Afghan side “uncalled for aggression”, while Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the incident.\nSubsequently, Pakistani officials sought to play down the Dec 11 incident saying Kabul had apologised for the attack, while some parliamentarians urged ‘reconciliatory’ efforts between the two neighbours.\n\nAlthough Pakistani officials continue in global forums to call for greater international engagement with Taliban authorities and urge financial assistance for Afghanistan, Pakistan’s own engagement with Kabul is becoming a source of increasing frustration. This is privately acknowledged by officials but the public posture is different — relations with the country’s western neighbour remain ‘normal’ and stable.\nHarsh statements follow border clashes, but these are par for the course, they claim. Instead, they point to strengthening trade ties, as also reflected in 60 meetings on commercial issues between the two countries since the Taliban assumed power.\nHowever, last month saw a significant departure from the all-is-well public stance. This came in the policy statement delivered byMohammed Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, in the meeting of Moscow Format member states on Nov 16 in Russia.\nPresenting a ‘progress report’ of 16 months of Taliban rule, he said the expectations of Pakistan and the international community had not been met on key issues. On political inclusivity, “there is little to show”; “the rights of women and girls also appear to have regressed”; and “the footprint of terrorist organisations in Afghanistan” had yet to be eradicated.\nHis remarks were an acknowledgment that for all the engagement with Kabul, its rulers had not budged an inch on these counts. He attributed the lack of adequate international humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan to the “cascade of unmet expectations”. In other words, the Taliban’s failure to deliver on three core promises made to the international community was exacting a cost, but not persuading Kabul to change its ways.\nBetween appeasement and confrontation, there is room for a strategy that protects Pakistan’s security interests.\nThesubsequent visit to Kabulby the minister of state for foreign affairs, Hina Rabbani Khar, also yielded little by way of Taliban flexibility on these core issues. Khar conveyed Pakistan’s views, including on girls’ education, as firmly as she could, but Taliban ministers offered the usual assurances, while giving no commitments, not least because decision-making power lies not with the cabinet in Kabul but the hard-line leadership in Kandahar.\nStatements issued by both sides after the meetings focused mainly on trade issues and avoided mention of sources of discord between the two countries.\nJust days after the visit, Pakistan’s ambassador and itsdiplomatic mission in Kabul came under attack, in which a security guard was wounded. This further strained relations. Meanwhile, escalation in cross-border terror attacks by TTP, the militant group still based in Afghanistan, continues to test relations between the two countries. Islamabad’s expectations that the Taliban’s return to power would enable Pakistan to secure its western border have not been met.\nInstead, Pakistan’s security concerns have mounted with the spike in cross-border attacks by the TTP since theTaliban took over the country. Over 140 Pakistani security personnel have lost their lives in these attacks in the past year or so.\nA report earlier this year by the UN Security Council’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team found that “TTP has arguably benefited the most of all the foreign extremist groups in Afghanistan from the Taliban takeover”.\nThe TTP has continued to carry out brazen attacks targeting Pakistani security personnel. Last month, the banned groupdeclared an end to its ceasefirewith the government on the grounds that military operations against it have continued. It threatened a new wave of retaliatory attacks across the country.\n\nThe ceasefire had never worked anyway. Neither did negotiations with the TTP that Pakistani military officials conducted in a bid to end the armed group’s 14-year war on Pakistan. Talks broke down months ago when it became clear that the TTP’s demands were non-negotiable. Although Kabul is urging Islamabad to resume these talks, there is no longer any Pakistani interest in doing so — an admission that direct talks with the TTP backfired as they only emboldened the militant group and was responsible for the TTP’s effort to stage a (failed) comeback in Swat.\nIn the face of mounting security concerns emanating from Afghanistan, what are Pakistan’s options? One, do more of the same, expand trade relations, help Afghanistan in other ways but raise security and other concerns in the hope of eliciting a response from Kabul. This, however, won’t produce an outcome any different from the past and will continue to be an exercise in futility.\nThe second option is a ‘tough love’ approach — using Pakistan’s considerable, unused leverage in a carefully calibrated way from a policy toolkit of incentives and disincentives to secure the necessary response.\nThe third option is to forge a coordinated regional strategy using collective leverage to bring pressure to bear on Kabul. Security, after all, is a concern for all Afghanistan’s neighbours, even if their other interests vary. The second and third options are not mutually exclusive and can and should be used in tandem.\nStable ties with Afghanistan are Pakistan’s strategic compulsion. But between appeasement and confrontation, there is room to craft a policy approach that effectively protects Pakistan’s security interests. For that, our security managers must first accept that the country’s present Afghan policy is now untenable."}]}

He also announced a date for this, Dec 23.\nChief Minister Parvez Elahi went along grudgingly with this decision even though in a subsequent press conference he claimed 99 per cent of people in the country were opposed to dissolution and the ‘establishment’ wanted the present political process to continue.\nIn his presser, Elahiassailed Khan for his public criticismof his one-time benefactor, former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa. He recalled what Bajwa had done to aid PTI’s ascent to power and said it did not behoove Khan to be ungrateful.\nThis open criticism of Khan and expression of reservations about dissolution conveyed the impression that there could be a parting of ways between the two allies. That, of course, didn’t happen. Elahi’s posturing may have had more to do with bargaining for a better deal with PTI for ‘seat adjustment’ for the next election.\nMeanwhile, the PDM governmentlaunched a series of movesto avert the possibility of dissolution. Their members in the provincial assembly moved a motion for a no-trust vote while the governor asked the chief minister to seek a vote of confidence.\nSure enough, the speaker ruled the governor’s order unconstitutional and Punjab descended into political and constitutional chaos. The governor ‘denotified’ the CM and Punjab cabinet and the dispute inevitably landed up in the Lahore High Court, which restored Elahi till the next hearing.\n\nThese developments in Punjab, which has been in an unsettled state for the past eight months, have destabilised not just the province but also the country. They have paralysed the most populous province and plunged Pakistan into uncharted territory.\nMore significantly, the uncertainty that has been unleashed is having an adverse impact on the economy, already teetering on the brink of insolvency. More political turmoil will exact an even heavier price on the economy.\nThe question then is whether calling general elections can be a way out of the political crisis and bring an end to the instability being witnessed today, especially in the midst of a deteriorating economic situation.\nWill early elections end the country’s political crisis?\nFor elections to resolve the present crisis and establish political stability, several things will need to happen. It is by no means clear whether this will be the case. First and foremost, there would have to be agreement between the principal political rivals on an interim government, at the federal and provincial levels.\nAgreement on who should head a neutral caretaker government to oversee elections is a constitutional requirement under Article 224.\n\nIn the absence of consensus between the government and opposition on an interim set-up, the matter would go for decision to a parliamentary committee. If that fails to reach agreement, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) will have to make that call, under the constitutionally prescribed procedure (Article 224-A).\nSecond, political leaders would have to accept the ECP as constituted at present and show confidence in its ability to hold free and fair elections. The ECP is an independent constitutional body responsible for organising and conducting elections.\nThe problem arises because Imran Khan has constantly attacked the chief election commissioner and the ECP, accusing them of being biased against him and partial towards his opponents. This without producing a shred of evidence to back his charge and despite a series of decisive victories by his party in successive by-elections.\nKhan clearly cannot have a CEC — a constitutional office — of his own choice. Therefore, he or anyone else who questions the ECP or the CEC’s neutrality, would have to set aside their objections and accept the present electoral set-up and arrangements for elections to go ahead.\n\nThree, political leaders and parties have to accept prevailing election laws and rules and code of conduct and also agree on the rules of the road leading up to polls. These are explicit, constitutionally mandated, codified and amended over time to define how elections are to be held. This obliges candidates to abide by them to ensure peaceful, free and fair elections.\nFour and most important, for elections to be a stabilising factor for the country, major political parties and political contenders must be ready to accept the outcome, whatever it turns out to be. Unfortunately, the past is not encouraging on this count as just about every election result has been disputed in Pakistan’s chequered political history. In 2013, when Khan’s PTI lost to the PML-N, he alleged vote rigging and called the general election the “biggest fraud” in the country’s history.\nHe demanded an investigation into the alleged ballot fraud, held protests and a prolonged dharna in the capital for over four months. Eventually, a judicial commission was appointed after agreement between the PML-N government and PTI to investigate the allegations. Its report found no evidence of systematic rigging, only local irregularities, which Khan was forced to reluctantly accept.\nWhen Khan won the 2018 elections, both the PML-N and PPP accused his party, aided by the establishment, of widespread rigging. Throughout the 1990s, the PML-N and PPP took turns to accuse each other of winning by fraudulent means. This troubled history throws up an unanswered question — will all political competitors accept the outcome of future elections?\n\nFinally, given the perilous state of the economy political leaders should be ready to accept and support rather than stoke controversy over urgent steps an interim government may need to take during its brief tenure to avert a financial collapse.\nAlthough the caretaker government’s principal responsibility will be to supervise free and fair elections it may have to take measures to deal with an economic emergency. After all, unless the country’s economic survival is assured everything else will be in vain."}]}

It confronted a polycrisis — several crises that converged to reinforce each other and create an overall challenge tougher to deal with than any single crisis. A political crisis, often with constitutional implications raged through the year, the economic crisis aggravated, the worst climate-induced floods in the country’s history tested national resilience and a resurgence of terrorist violence revived threats to Pakistan’s security.\nTheouster of prime minister Imran Khan’s governmentby a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in April set in train a series of events that drove the country into a state of perpetual crisis. Several aspects of the crisis distinguished it from those in the country’s chequered past. Never before was a prime minister removed by a no-trust vote. The crisis came to encompass all the country’s institutions — Supreme Court, parliament, Presidency, Punjab Assembly, ECP as well as the military, despite its claim to stay away from the political fray. Also there were few parallels in the country’s history of disruptions that delayed the transfer of power.\nUnwilling to accept the loss of power, Khan launched a series of actions to first circumvent and then respond to the no-confidence move. He crafted the narrative of a foreign conspiracy to explain his ouster, openly accusing the army leadership of being part of this conspiracy. Although he never produced any evidence to back his charge — and later backtracked on this — it found ready believers among his loyal political base. The aim to delegitimise his opponents backfired especially as military spokesmen flatlyrejected this narrative as false. As did a meeting of the National Security Committee.\nKhan’s exit from power opened a new, uncertain and volatile phase in Pakistan’s politics. Led by PML-N, the 13-party PDM coalition that assumed power, got off to a slow and unsure start as it had to initially overcome impediments in the way of a smooth transition. Cobbling together a coalition cabinet — the largest in the country’s history — also took time and underlined the difficulties of forging agreement among disparate parties. Nevertheless, Khan’s fierce opposition kept this coalition united even if some constituent parties needed high maintenance from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was also obliged to constantly consult Mian Nawaz Sharif in London.\nPakistan has to meet multiple challenges in 2023 in a deeply fractured and polarised state.\nConfrontational politics remained the overarching reality of 2022. Imran Khan sought through the year to mount pressure on the government to hold immediate general elections. But PDM insisted on continuing in office until parliament completed its full term in August 2023. The country’s largest province and political heartland, Punjab, becoming the arena of nonstop power struggles. PTI and its ally, PML-Q led by Parvez Elahi, was able to seize control of the government after Hamza Sharif’s brief tenure. But the province remained unsettled with governance all but paralysed due to the stand-off between Lahore and Islamabad. At year end, both sides were locked in a fierce fight — PTI to secure dissolution of the provincial assembly and the PDM coalition to avert that by political manoeuvres.\n\nCeaseless political confrontation signalled the breakdown of politics in 2022. Amid heightening tensions, political disputes were no longer amenable to resolution by political means. Political rivals either resorted to the courts or turned to the army to further their political aims. An opposition-less National Assembly was marginalised and the political system came under increasing stress. State institutions faced growing pressure. The superior courts were expected by both sides to not just adjudicate legal and constitutional issues but also decide political matters. This turned the courts into arbiters of politics, rather than arbiters of law. The army became the target of repeated criticism by Khan and the subject of unprecedented public and media debate. It was variously accused of not intervening or intervening too much.\nThe economy was the make-or-break issue for the ruling coalition and country in the outgoing year. Deepening polarisation and political turmoil exacerbated the economic challenge with uncertainty casting a long shadow over a worsening public finance crisis. The dire situation urged Sharif to secure resumption of the IMF programme and seek funds from friendly countries to finance the record current account deficit, meet debt repayments and try to stabilise the precarious macroeconomic situation. Soaring inflation emerged as an even bigger political threat than Khan for the government, fuelling widespread public discontent.\nThe country saw the worst floods in its history which impacted over 33 million people and caused extensive displacement and destruction. The death toll exceeded 1,200, with massive damage to crops, homes and infrastructure. Relief and rehabilitation efforts by the authorities were augmented by financial assistance from overseas but it was clear that recovery would need more time and money. At the end of the year, flood victims in many areas faced food shortages and the risk of disease. The disaster imposed a heavy financial burden on an already struggling economy.\nThe government’s change of finance ministers five months into its tenure injected more uncertainty into a tenuous economic situation. As foreign exchange reserves depleted, the rupee weakened, exports declined, remittances contracted and debt payments piled up, speculation about a sovereign default began to intensify in the face of heavy external obligations ahead. Government ministers, however, rejected this as alarmist. The situation entered a critical phase when reserves plunged to $5.8 billion. By year end, it was unclear how Pakistan would navigate the economic crisis, especially in view of delay in the release of an IMF tranche in the bailout programme.\n\nImran Khan’sannouncementin December to dissolve the Punjab and KP assemblies added to political and economic uncertainty and served to further darken the outlook for an economy teetering on the brink of insolvency. As if this wasn’t enough, the country witnessed a fresh wave of terrorist violence, with TTP militants striking across KP and beyond, including the capital. Clashes on the Pak-Afghan border and terror attacks on security personnel in Balochistan underlined growing security problems on the western frontier. But this confluence of political, economic and security challenges did little to unite the country’s political leaders. Instead, it left Pakistan having to negotiate multiple crises in 2023 in an unprecedentedly fractured state."}]}

The media has been muzzled, and journalists jailed and prevented from travelling overseas. Human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and torture, continue with impunity while the entire leadership of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) remains in detention. More paramilitary forces were inducted into the world’s most militarised region.\n\nA more egregious example of repression such as that in Kashmir can hardly be found anywhere in the world. Yet this grim situation is met by silence from countries that claim to be standard-bearers of human rights. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s international campaign to expose this is fitful at best, preoccupied as it is with multiple crises at home. Islamabad’s Kashmir diplomacy is now limited to just sending letters to the UN.\nAlthough the occupied territory has seen violent oppression for over seven decades, Delhi’sunilateral actionon Aug 5, 2019, opened a more brutal chapter in Kashmir’s tortured history. The Indian government illegally annexed the state of Jammu and Kashmir, bifurcated it, and integrated it into the Indian union. This was in blatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions. There are 11 resolutions on Kashmir. Specifically, it was a contravention of UNSC Resolution 38, whose para 2 clearly states that neither party to the dispute can bring about a material change in the situation in Kashmir.\nA prolonged lockdown and communication blackout was imposed, the military siege tightened, public assembly was banned, the press silenced and Kashmiri leaders, including pro-Delhi politicians, jailed to prevent a popular upsurge against the move that robbed the Kashmiri people of virtually all their rights.\n\nSince then, the BJP government has taken a number of steps —administrative, demographic and electoral — to disempower and disenfranchise Kashmiris and change the Muslim identity of Kashmir. Several actions mimic Israeli settler policies in occupied Palestine. In May 2022, India’s Delimitation Commission announced a plan to carve out new electoral constituencies, aimed at giving Jammu greater representation to reduce the political weight of Muslims in the J&K assembly and shift the balance to Hindus. Muslims constitute over 68 per cent of J&K’s population while Hindus represent around 28pc according to the (last) 2011 census. The BJP government wants through the delimitation plan to turn the Muslim majority into a minority.\nIndia’s actions in the occupied region mimic Israeli settler policies in Palestine.\nDemographic changes have also been set in train by new domicile rules introduced by Delhi. Over 3.4 million so-called domicile certificates have been issued to non-Kashmiri outsiders, who became eligible after abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A of the Indian constitution in 2019. In July 2022, the chief election officer in the occupied Valley announced granting voting rights to any Indian citizen, even temporary residents, in a brazen effort to change the region’s demography. This would add almost 2.5m additional voters, including non-locals, to the electoral rolls. It represents an increase of 30pc voters to the electorate. Like the delimitation plan, this announcement provoked anger and resentment in Kashmir. APHC leaders denounced it and as did traditionally pro-India former chief ministers and politicians. Farooq Abdullah’s National Conference said the “inclusion of non-locals” was a “clear-cut ploy to disenfranchise the people of J&K”.\nNone of this has deterred the Modi government from pressing ahead. Nor have its actions been limited to electoral gerrymandering. Last year, BJP authorities seized the J&K Waqf Board and thus all its properties across the region. This marked a drive to take control of all prominent places of religious significance for Muslims in the occupied territory, including shrines. Religious leaders and Islamic scholars were arrested and prayers have been barred in many mosques across Kashmir. In the guise of cracking down on Jamaat-i-Islami, banned in 2019, the authorities have more recently seized properties worth millions of rupees. This includes a home that once belonged to the iconic Hurriyat leader, Syed Ali Geelani, who was denied a proper funeral in 2021.\nBJP’s attack on Kashmiri culture has also involved eroding the status of Urdu. For over 100 years, Urdu was the official language of J&K. But in 2020, Urdu’s exclusive status was ended by legislation that made Hindi, Kashmiri and Dogri official languages in J&K, in addition to Urdu and English. Moves are now afoot to change the script of the Kashmiri language from Nastaliq to the Devanagri script.\n\nNone of this has attracted much international attention. What has been denounced by international human rights organisations is the silencing of Kashmir’s media, the arrest of journalists under sedition and anti-terror laws and the atmosphere of intimidation that has been created especially in the wake of the new, harsh media policy of 2020. In February 2022, Human Rights Watch condemned the intensified crackdown on the independent media and noted the “increasing harassment, threats, and prosecutions of journalists and human rights activists” in Kashmir. In September 2022, Amnesty International detailed the clampdown on the media and sweeping curbs on the freedom of expression, noting that the Kashmir Press Club had been closed down.\nThe BJP government seeks to use intensified repression, demographic changes and changing the electoral map to set the stage for eventual elections in J&K. This aims to consolidate and ‘legitimise’ its August 2019 action and enable Delhi to claim that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir has been ‘normalised’. But its efforts to entice and enlist even pro-India Kashmiri leaders to support this plan have failed. In the face of overwhelming Kashmiri opposition to the delimitation plan and new voting rules, it is hard to see how elections can be held, and if they are, whether they will be credible. Delhi’s policies of force and fraud have long failed in Kashmir and only deepened the alienation of its people and strengthened their resolve to resist occupation. There is little reason to think this will change in the future."}]}

He had this to say then: “Economic management in Pakistan has steadily deteriorated to the point where the economy has lurched from one financial crisis to the next. At the heart of the problem has been poor management of public finances and deep-seated unresolved structural issues in the economy that bad management and poor governance has exacerbated. The consequences are plain to see: macroeconomic instability, high inflation, poor public services, criminal neglect of the social sectors, widespread corruption, crippling power outages, growing unemployment, deepening poverty and a deteriorating debt profile.”\nMeekal also wrote, “An IMF programme gets some reforms implemented as part of its conditionality but as soon as the programme is over or ended by the authorities’ themselves mid-way, all the reforms are rolled back.”\nTwenty-three years later nothing has changed. This paragraph could well have been written today. Its summary of the outcome of poor economic governance is an apt description of the present economic disarray. For many decades successive governments, civilian and military, with few exceptions, pursued similar policies that contributed to or reinforced Pakistan’s structural economic problems. In fact, their foreign policy and economic management intersected to produce an outcome in which the country became increasingly dependent on external financial assistance, aid and borrowing rather than finding a viable development path by relying on itself and safeguarding its economic sovereignty.\n\nThe pattern of external overreach and internal underreach persists. This has got to a point where securing funds/loans from friendly countries and international financial institutions is now celebrated by government officials and even deemed by sections of the media as major policy successes. Such claims are blind to the ineluctable reality that living off other people’s money is hardly a national achievement. They provide false comfort to the ruling elite but do nothing to resolve the country’s economic problems.\n\nThe source of the country’s recurring economic crises is of course its fiscal deficit — a measure of governments constantly living beyond their means, unwilling to raise domestic resources and engaging in unrestrained spending. The fiscal deficit has been the source of persistent macroeconomic instability, high inflation and balance-of-payments crises. Over the decades, the twin deficits of the budget and balance-of-payments were managed by dysfunctional economic policies. Significantly the country’s external alignments fed into and facilitated this.\nLiving off other people’s money is hardly a national achievement.\nIn earlier decades Pakistan’s Cold War alliance with the West offered policymakers the means to finance deficits with soft loans. Successive governments — dominated by rural and urban elites — therefore found the way to avoid reforms, raise sufficient revenue or tax themselves or their support base. Dependence on external resources to finance both development and consumption was thus both encouraged and enabled by the availability of concessional assistance as a consequence of the country’s foreign alignments. Cold War assistance accompanied Pakistan’s close alliance with the US, then cemented by military pacts. Then in the 1980s, Western aid flowed as a strategic payback for Pakistan’s pivotal role in resisting and rolling back the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. 9/11 again turned Pakistan into a front-line state and increased its strategic importance for Washington, which mobilised international efforts to provide financial resources and IMF financing for budgetary support as well as debt restructuring to ease Islamabad’s economic problems.\nThe result was aid-fuelled economic growth during much of the period of Gen Ziaul Haq’s and president Pervez Musharraf’s governments, which created an illusion of economic progress. ‘Borrowed growth’ may not have had such deleterious consequences if the fiscal space it provided was used to launch reforms to address Pakistan’s underlying structural problems: widen the tax base, document the economy, diversify exports, and boost savings to finance an investment level to sustain an economic growth rate higher than the rise in population. But this did not happen. The availability of external financial resources along with high remittance inflows from overseas Pakistanis simply enabled the country’s economic managers to postpone reforms, ignore the structural problems of the economy and pursue dysfunctional policies. Moreover, once concessional financing began to taper off, it was replaced by expensive foreign and domestic borrowing. This ‘borrowed growth’ was not only unsustainable but came at the enormous price of debt accumulation.\nThe mid-1980s marked a sharp break in Pakistan’s budgetary history, with revenue no longer matching even the government’s current expenditure. For the next decade and beyond successive governments borrowed heavily to finance not only development but also consumption. In the process, the country accumulated unsustainable debt both by borrowing abroad and at home. This burden continues to cripple the economy today.\n\nIn recent years, reliance on the West has been replaced by dependence on close strategic ally China, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, who have provided financial help to bail out the country from economic and liquidity crises. Rollover of debt and deposits in the central bank to shore up reserves have been among the ways this has been done. Announcements last week from the UAE and Saudi Arabia are the latest illustration of this. It again underlines the intersection of foreign alignments and financial help to overcome economic crisis. It also demonstrates how governments continue to look outside to rescue the country’s economy when it teeters on the brink of insolvency. That Pakistan is now in its 23rd IMF programme is another testimony of this.\n\nThe habit of depending on others has become so deeply entrenched in the country’s political culture that there is little if any questioning of this among those in power or for that matter in the establishment whose leaders join in and often spearhead the effort to seek ‘lifeline’ funds from friendly countries. This reflects the failure of economic governance as it involves lurching from one crisis to another with no ability to avert the next one with outsiders seen as stopgap answers to the cash-strapped country’s perennial economic problems. Above all this approach reduces the country to the unfortunate status of a supplicant whose economic survival depends not on itself but on others."}]}

A Dismantled State: the untold story of Kashmir after Article 370 by Anurudha Bhasin is a scathing indictment of Indian actions in Jammu and Kashmir following its annexation and bifurcation byabrogation of Article 370of the Indian constitution on Aug 5, 2019. As a prominent journalist, executive editor ofKashmir Timesand resident of Kashmir, Anurudha has long witnessed the turmoil, violence, injustices and vicissitudes of political life there. But post-August 2019, which saw J&K’s dismemberment and disempowerment, was a fundamental break from the past. She describes her book’s aim as discovering how this period that drastically altered the sociopolitical and economic landscape “impacted the people of J&K in their day-to-day lives”. The book is an effort to “combat disinformation in Kashmir’s dangerous information desert”.\nI asked the author in an email exchange what motivated her to write this ground-breaking book, the first and only one to detail the trials and tribulations of Kashmir and its people post-August 2019. Anurudha said almost a year after Kashmir lost its special status, she began trying to make sense of what was happening on the ground. The geographical and political map of the state had been altered and what followed a year later were drastic and radical legal changes with a momentous impact on the lives of people there. But as very little was known and there was little media coverage, she began digging for facts in a “complete desert of information”. Among the impediments she faced was people’s reluctance to be interviewed due to the climate of fear.\n\nIn the book, Anurudha provides a vivid window into the atmosphere of J&K when the Aug 5 action was taken. The deployment of additional troops and “sound of regular chopper sorties” preceding the move had already created panic, fear and foreboding among people. She shows how the Pulwama incident and the officially sponsored narrative of antipathy towards Kashmiri Muslims prepared the ground for August 2019. In fact, through many political, military and administrative manoeuvres “the ground was being readied for bulldozing Kashmir’s special status, a year before it happened”.\nThe untold story of post-2019 trials and tribulations of the Kashmiri people.\nWhen the “constitutional fraud” was imposed, people’s world was “suddenly turned upside down while they were virtually trapped in their homes, with unannounced curfew and communication systems in complete disarray”. There was barbed wire and multitudes of barricades everywhere on sealed, trafficless roads.\nThousands of arrests and detentions followed in the crackdown — of political leaders, lawyers, traders, businessmen, academics, activists and even children in midnight raids. The draconian Public Safety Act was weaponised and subsequently used more widely, as was torture. Several cases are documented in this regard. The author writes that “the apparatus of terror and control — operated in the form of night raids, arbitrary arrests, detentions, torture and alleged sexual assault — continued for days”. Virtually imprisoned by the lockdown, 13.65 million people were placed under siege. Internet was shut down and a communication blockade imposed. Most people, she says, had no idea then of the fate decided for them by Delhi. “Existence and identity, as we knew it, had been altered.”\n\nAlthough the book examines the post-August 2019 period, the author also reflects on decades of Delhi’s failed policies in J&K — policies of manipulation and jailing of leaders combined with military coercion. This portion offers a clear analysis of how in the last seven decades successive governments dealt with the Kashmir conflict through force and manipulation, with the “Modi-led BJP government, consistently contributing to deepening the conflict by pursuing an all-out military policy”. “Militancy,” she asserts, “was a symptom of a deeper malaise — an unaddressed political dispute, subversion of democracy and democratic rights of the people and neglect of human rights violations.”\nCommenting on recent trends in militancy, she argues that unlike in the 1990s, when boys crossed the border into Azad Kashmir to receive weapons and training, the new wave of militancy is mostly homegrown. Post-2019 militancy feeds on anger and “thrives on local support” and has been increasing with rising local recruitment.\nThe book catalogues the plethora of laws that were changed or promulgated mostly during, and taking advantage of, the Covid-19 pandemic. In October 2020, the government brought in 26 land-related laws which marginalised locals and aimed to deprive them of land. Under other changes, land could be seized from locals and given to outsiders. Overall, out of 334 state laws, 164 laws were repealed, and 167 laws adapted. Also detailed is the electoral delimitation plan unveiled in 2022 that sought to change the demographic character of the region and make way for J&K’s first Hindu chief minister. Addition of new voters to the electoral rolls, which gave non-residents voting rights, also aimed at enabling a BJP majority whenever election to the J&K assembly is held. All this has left Kashmir demoted, disempowered and disenfranchised.\n\nSignificantly, Anurudha sees India’s tightening military control, silencing of dissent, bulldozing of its economy and demography and assault on civil liberties as unsustainable and therefore believes its Kashmir strategy is bound to fail. Although the BJP government has disingenuously sought to portray the imposed silence in Kashmir as acceptance, the reality is of seething and massive discontent and deepening alienation from which “India stands to be the bigger loser”.\nI asked Anurudha how she sees the situation play out from here. She said while all of J&K’s people including Hindus and Sikhs feel robbed, “the Muslim majority reels under an existential threat”. But a deafening silence has been produced by the jailing of politicians and civil society activists as well as throttling of the media. This, she says, portends danger because it makes it impossible to fully understand or assess the ground situation. It also makes it difficult to predict how Kashmiris will eventually respond, because respond they will. In fact, a key message of her book is that “a volcanic outburst is simply a matter of time”. I couldn’t agree more with the conclusion."}]}

This was also the theme of the annual Davos meeting earlier this month. The perfect storm, he maintained, was raging on several fronts, especially economic, with an unfolding cost-of-living crisis, rising inequality, looming recession, energy crunch, soaring inflation and supply chain disruptions among its many aspects. Yet, when international solidarity was needed most, geopolitical rifts and the deepening North-South divide was undermining efforts to meet global challenges.\nThere is no doubt that the world is at an inflection point and in the midst of an intensely unsettled period. Instability is being engendered by rising geopolitical tensions and global economic volatility. Power shifts continue in an increasingly fragmented international system, with multilateralism under growing stress. Uncertainty is the ‘new normal’ and the outlook remains troubled. Most assessments by experts paint a picture of unpredictability ahead, with strong headwinds unleashed by competing crises and a multiplicity of interconnected but so far unmet challenges.\n\nThe World Economic Forum’s annual Global Risks Report sees an era of low-growth, low cooperation and low investment with the cost-of-living crisis presenting the biggest short-term risk confronting the world right now, and climate change as the biggest long-term threat. It identifies old and new risks which are converging to shape a fraught landscape, and finds that economic warfare has become the norm, with increasing clashes between major powers and geopolitical cooperation eroding. The report makes for sober reading, even though it expresses the hope that collective and decisive action would help to chart a way towards a more positive, inclusive and stable world.\nBut for now, global stability is nowhere in sight. The major contributory factors to the ongoing geopolitical turbulence and economic disruption are the war initiated by theRussian invasion of Ukraineand continuingUS-China confrontation. The Ukraine war, which has had global repercussions, will soon enter its second year, with no negotiated end to the conflict in sight. Russian forces are reported to be readying themselves for a spring offensive. Few, if any, diplomatic efforts are underway for a ceasefire or dialogue, which indicates that a prolonged war of attrition lies ahead. Russian targeting of Ukrainian infrastructure and strikes on key cities have not sapped Kyiv’s will to resist and fight. Nor has Western unity to help Ukraine weakened. Sophisticated military weapons have been sent to Ukraine to give it a qualitative edge in armaments. In what is described as a major policy shift, Germany and the US now plan to send battle tanks to Ukraine to help it counter Russian offensives. A week ago, the US and Nato indicated supplying a package of heavy weapons to Ukraine. All this suggests an escalation in coming months.\nWith rising geopolitical tensions, a divided and leaderless world is unable to meet global challenges.\nThe war has taken a heavy toll on the global economy, coming as it did on the back of the pandemic and its devastating economic fallout. It has disrupted global supply chains, trade, commodity and energy markets.  The conflict has given rise to soaring food prices, while supply disruptions have intensified inflationary pressures across the world. This has hit poorer, debt-burdened economies especially hard. With major economies struggling to curb inflation, global financial conditions have also tightened. Weak global growth holds the prospect of recession in major economies and beyond. The international economic environment is in a volatile and uncertain state and facing a bleak future.\n\nThe Ukraine crisis isn’t the only challenge to international peace and stability. Another major source of global instability is the turbulent relationship between the US and China, the world’s most consequential bilateral relationship and a defining feature of the global landscape today. Relations between them have sunk to a historic low, raising concerns across the world about the advent of a new Cold War. Tensions have ensued in most part from America’s policy to contain China’s rise, which is being countered by an assertive response from Beijing. The US seeks to reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains and products to decouple its economy from China’s. This has involved waging a trade war with Beijing. Guterres describes the risk of decoupling of the world’s two largest economies as the ‘Great Fracture’. He has often urged both countries to avoid decoupling, which would have deleterious consequences for them as well as the rest of the world.\nA meeting last October between Presidents Biden and Xi Jinping in Bali — their first — on the sidelines of the G20 summit raised hopes of a de-escalation of tensions and a move towards a more stable relationship between the global powers. But it did not result in any narrowing of differences over the contentious issues and disputes that divide them, includingTaiwan, trade, technology curbs and military postures. Indeed, both sides again spelt out their respective red lines on Taiwan.\nWhile Taiwan represents the most dangerous arena of US-China confrontation, tensions are escalating on other fronts too. Washington is engaged in a battle to maintain supremacy in technology. Its national security strategy unveiled in October 2022 declares the aim is to outpace China in the technological domain. Last October, the US imposed a sweeping ban on American companies from exporting chips and advanced chip equipment to China in order to cripple its semiconductor industry. These export restrictions were the latest in the tech war and were described as “the biggest shift in US policy” on technology exports to China since the 1990s. Apart from taking this issue to the WTO, China is expected to enhance funding to its semiconductor industry. But it is by no means clear whether Washington will be able to coax its allies to join the restrictions, as the interests of their companies diverge with the US on these unilateral measures. This nevertheless underlines how intense the tech war has become.\nOf course, there are other sources of instability in the world. What all of them add up to is a deeply divided and leaderless world which is increasingly falling short of addressing multiple global challenges that are cascading into what Guterres rightly calls an impending perfect storm."}]}

Indeed, there is no indication that political leaders are willing to pause their political war to find solutions to Pakistan’s multiple crises. Instead, recent developments have plunged politics into a more volatile and confused state. Uncertainty rules as politics gets messier.\nThe dissolution of the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies opened another chapter in the fierce political confrontation between the government and opposition. While opposition leader Imran Khan hoped this would force the PDM government to call early general elections, the ruling alliance stuck to its guns and insisted that national polls would only be held once parliament completes its full term in August. But it left the PML-N-led government having to deal with the constitutional obligation of holding elections to provincial assemblies in the stipulated 90-day period. Its governor in Punjab is howeverdemurring over fixing a date. This despite the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) writing to him and proposing dates between April 9 and 13 and reminding him of his constitutional duty to announce elections within 90 days from the date of dissolution of the assembly. ECP has also suggested between April 15 and 17 for the KP election.\n\nThe delay reflects PML-N’s reluctance to press ahead on this count. This was laid bare in a recent meeting of PDM heads. News reports indicated that a case was made by some in the party to delay provincial elections on the grounds that these should follow a digital census due to get underway in March. This, it was argued, would be consistent with an earlier decision of the Council of Common Interests that the next elections should be held according to a new census. This argument ignores the fact that such decisions cannot override constitutional stipulations. Some in the ruling party have apparently invoked the financial cost of holding multiple elections as an argument for delay, pointing out that holding two provincial and national elections at a different time would be unprecedented in the country’s history.\nPML-N’s assessment seems to be that provincial elections within 90 days would advantage Khan. If PTI does exceptionally well that would set the template for national polls later. Given the political cost the ruling alliance is incurring due to thetough economic measuresit is taking to resume the IMF loan programme and the worsening energy crisis, it needs time for a course correction to improve its position before going to the polls. Party leaders also think more time would enable them to end internal discord and divisions in what is their rudderless Punjab organisation today.\nThe country’s multiple crises have not persuaded political leaders to pause the political war.\nWhether or not this political calculation is well grounded, any effort to delay provincial elections will further complicate the situation, even spark a constitutional crisis. The matter will again be left to the courts to decide. Already the governor’s prevarication over fixing an election date is in court. More litigation can be expected with the Supreme Court likely to be involved if provincial polls are postponed beyond April. This would mean asking the courts to suspend the 90-day constitutional requirement, which will take some doing. It will certainly reinforce the growing impression that PDM is running scared of elections.\nFor his part, KP Governor Ghulam Ali has said that the law and order situation in his province was not suitable to hold elections. After theterrorist attack on a mosque in Peshawar, which claimed over 100 lives, he wrote a letter to the ECP. In this he asked it to consult all relevant stakeholders including political parties and law-enforcement agencies before fixing a date for the polls in view of the “alarming” security situation in the province. Later, the Punjab governor wrote a similar letter to ECP citing the country’s security as well as economic situation. While the timing of provincial elections is still up in the air, if they are held on schedule, it will mean there will be elected, and not neutral caretaker governments in place when general elections are held. This will create its own complications and hand the losing party an excuse to explain its defeat and more consequentially to reject the outcome — a catch-22 situation.\nAdding to the current political confusion are by-elections announced to 33 National Assembly seats for March 16. ECP has fixed March19 for another 31 seats. These became vacant after the resignations of PTI MNAs were hurriedly accepted by the National Assembly speaker. So, a major electoral exercise will get underway in March whose outcome may shape political dynamics for general elections but in which winning candidates from PTI will not even join the current NA. In any case, whoever wins will only serve for four months as a member before the Assembly is dissolved. The PPP has decided to contest the by-elections but PML-N is still undecided — indecision increasingly becoming the hallmark of the party leadership.\nThere are two important conclusions to draw from all of this. One, that political turmoil, ceaseless power struggles and frequent appeals to courts to settle political disputes are all taking place at a time when the country is faced with serious challenges to its financial solvency and security. This shows a disconnect from reality by the warring parties. It also suggests a lack of concern for issues that will actually determine the fate and fortunes of the country. Two, the searing political divide and polarisation portends a troubled outlook for what might happen before, during and after general elections, whenever they are called. With political parties constantly on a collision course, unable to agree on anything and confronting each other on everything, there is little chance of any consensus on the rules of the road leading to national polls and, more importantly, on accepting its outcome. This suggests political stability might remain elusive in a country that needs it more desperately now than ever."}]}

In the political confrontation raging today, the preoccupation of political leaders is with outmanoeuvring opponents, not explaining how they propose to solve national problems or what their parties stand for. This at a time when the country’s multiple challenges are crying out for solutions and answers. Above all, a polarised environment marked by constant exchange of toxic rhetoric makes it impossible to evolve much-needed consensus on key national issues. It also creates an atmosphere inimical to the generation of new ideas.\n\nThe political discourse today consists predominantly of bitter invective and aggressive rhetoric along with unceasing efforts by political leaders to denigrate opponents. Instead of debating public policy, much of the political conversation involves diatribes and allegations of malfeasance and venality hurled by political leaders against one another. This has spawned a form of issue-less politics, where instead of the country’s challenges being seriously discussed, political narratives are reduced to deriding rivals. Perhaps because parties no longer have any programmes, shallow narratives dominate politics. No political party has offered a credible vision of the country’s future, much less outlined a strategy to reach that destination.\nTake, for example, the response of both government and opposition figures to the two key challenges faced by the country today — an unprecedented economic crisis and the security threat from the renewed surge of militant violence. On the first, public exchanges have taken the form of who is responsible for pushing the economy into the critical ward. In other words, a blame game has been underway rather than an informed discussion of what Pakistan needs to do to salvage the economy on an enduring basis. The government has said it will take all the policy actions needed to reach an agreement with the IMF. But it has not spelled out any economic plan beyond securing the Fund bailout, which is necessary but not sufficient, for a sustainable way out of the country’s perpetual fiscal and balance-of-payments crisis. The IMF deal can only provide temporary relief. It should be an initial part, not substitute for a broader homegrown economic strategy to chart a path to growth. Tellingly, PML-N’s coalition partners, especially PPP, have shown little interest in saying anything on the economic situation, conveying the impression that they have nothing to do with how the economy is being managed. Meanwhile, opposition representatives have been castigating the government for taking steps to satisfy the IMF saying they will compound people’s hardship and misery. But they have not offered any alternative or their own vision of how the economic crisis should be addressed.\nPolitical leaders should be focusing on meeting the country’s challenges, not undermining opponents.\nA similar stance was on display in the response to militant violence. Both blamed each other for the current wave of terrorism sweeping across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Leaders of the ruling coalition at the centre accused Imran Khan and his KP government for pursuing policies that encouraged the return of militant activities and held the provincial government responsible for not acting against the TTP. Khan and his party leaders, on the other hand, claimed the province was peaceful when PTI was in power at the centre. They defended resettling TTP fighters in the province and said it was, in any case, the responsibility of federal agencies to deal with terrorism. Imran Khan also linked the surge in violence to his removal from power.\n\nFor his part, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif blamed the KP government for the surge of terrorism by failing to equip the police and civil armed forces to fight militants. He asked where funds allocated to the province for this purpose went. Meanwhile, the much-postponed ‘all-parties conference’ announced by him seemed little more than a cosmetic exercise when the atmosphere was vitiated by the arrests of opposition figures and the combative attitude adopted by the government against PTI and its allies. Repeated postponement of the APC showed a lack of seriousness. A serious move should involve holding a conference after and not before fashioning a coherent counter-militancy strategy, which is still lacking. Conferences are forums to ratify or tweak strategies, not frame them.\nAnother aspect of the poverty of political discourse is how platitudes and clichés are what some political leaders think is enough to convey their position in key policy areas. This again reflects the fact that their parties lack any programme, policy plan or aims. Banal pronunciations by power holders are reported daily by the media. Examples include: “Pakistan will be the investment centre in the region”; “We need to boost exports and productivity”; “We will protect the poor from inflation”; “We are committed to provide education for all”; “Education is the key to progress”; “Terrorism is Pakistan’s foremost problem”; “National unity is needed to fight terrorism”; and so on. These statements of the obvious say nothing about what the actual policy goals are, and more importantly, how they are to be achieved. It is as if mouthing platitudes will magically translate into policy and accomplish goals. If it isn’t platitudes, its exhortations — calling on people to unite, make sacrifices or show forbearance in the face of national adversity. Again, these are statements made in a policy vacuum. Platitudes are not a substitute for strategy any more than exhortations are for policy.\nPeople have much higher expectations of their leaders at times of crisis. They seek a clear and credible direction, assurance that national problems will be competently addressed, and above all, solidarity among public representatives so that they are seen to be working together to responsibly and purposefully address challenges. If all the public hears are allegations that the other side is unfit to govern and sees no efforts to discuss and act on issues of concern to them, it erodes trust in both politicians and the political system. Democracy is undermined when people see politics as just a power struggle shorn of public purpose."}]}

Chronic instability and an oligarchic political order impeded the evolution of modern governance.\nPatronage-based politics practised by elected and military governments alike relied on working networks of influential political families, kinship groups and biradaris to maintain them in power. But this mode of governance failed to meet the needs of an increasingly complex society. Yet the mass of unfulfilled public expectations never persuaded the elite to meaningfully respond to the needs and demands of the people.\nThis power elite resisted meaningful reform — whether land reform, tax reform or reforms in governance. It also acquired ‘rentier’ characteristics: using access to public office as a means of leveraging state resources to transfer wealth and acquire sources of unearned income.\nThis has been a common feature of both civilian and military elites. Both used patron-client relationships to reinforce their dominance and protect their economic interests and privileged status.\nWith successive civilian and military governments living beyond their means, unwilling to mobilise domestic resources and averse to economic reform, that fact alone contributed to miring Pakistan in perpetual financial crisis, with virtually every government in the past five decades leaving the economy in much worse shape for its successors to manage.\nBorrowing both at home and abroad became its preferred way of managing public finances, which has landed the country today with an unprecedented and unsustainable level of debt.\nCan the stranglehold of a narrow elite over the economic and political system be broken?\nThe politics and economics of elite ‘capture’ has long been discussed in the country. Published some years ago, Ishrat Husain’s impressive book, The Economy of an Elitist State, highlighted how one per cent of the population constituting an elite group maintained a stranglehold on the affairs of the state. Its power and dominance persisted through different forms and changes of government. As did inequality, which continues to characterise Pakistani society.\n\nHusain’s main argument was that the respective roles of the state and market had been reversed as a narrow elite rigged the markets and hijacked the state to advantage itself. It concluded that this concentration of wealth and political power at the expense of the majority of the population had created a situation that was neither socially acceptable nor economically sustainable.\nNow an important new book has joined this debate and generated many webinars and podcasts across the country that take this discussion forward. Big Capital in an Unequal World: The Micropolitics of Wealth in Pakistan by Rosita Armytage offers a fascinating insight into Pakistan’s ‘uppermost’ elite, and its networks and methods that help to maintain its position and reinforce inequality in the country.\nThe author casts her book as an ethnography of the micro-politics of elite lives, which she had the opportunity to observe during the time she spent in the country, working and then researching here. It is as much a study of the daily experience of modern capitalism among Pakistan’s business elite as an insight into the social conduct, relationship building, marriages and political connections of its members.\nShe describes Pakistan as a compelling case of elite power, which, like many rapidly developing states, is run by an oligarchy of economic and political interests and afflicted by high levels of instability. But this instability is encouraged by powerful families that benefit from it through what she calls the “culture of exemptions”.\nMore on this later. Armytage sets out to investigate Pakistan’s elite and configuration of power involving the institutions and structures that determine the allocation of wealth and political influence. But she finds that beneath the formal structure lie networks of power and influence linked by family and social connections through which economic and political competition, deals and alliances are, as it were, pre-negotiated.\nThe book argues that major wealth in the country is concentrated among a limited number of families that dominate the principal political parties and leading firms and have family links with the senior echelons of the military.\nShe observes that marriages among the slowly expanding elite help to create bonds between families and promote ‘political dynasty making’, which insulate elite members from threats to their power and influence.\n\nIn many respects, chapter six is the core — and the most interesting portion — of the book. In this, Armytage details the “culture of exemptions” that enable members of the elite to maintain and buttress their positions and thwart competition. The use of law as a mechanism, plus extra-legal and sometimes illegal activities constitute the means of wealth accumulation and preservation as well as tax avoidance.\nShe writes that, “Like the global elite of which they are a part, the Pakistani elite direct the legal and regulatory structures that determine the flows of wealth and opportunity within the country, while simultaneously operating outside of, and above these structures”. This she calls the culture of exemptions.\nThe broader conclusions she draws from her study are that elite capitalism in Pakistan is far from being an anomaly but the specific nature of its elite and highly localised form of business and finance contradicts the widely held assumption that the world is moving towards an era of globalised and standardised capitalism. An important finding is that Pakistan’s elite-dominated economy shows little sign of transitioning to a globalised high-finance economy.\nWhat rings so true is how its “hyper-provincialised” character gives its members an inward-looking economic and political focus. Most of the economic elite are not globally focused players and have also acquired an anti-West orientation.\nThis is a must-read book that should encourage more debate about the role of the elite and especially how its stranglehold over the economic and political system can be broken by a growing middle class that seeks, but has yet to secure a bigger voice in national affairs."}]}

It is now pitting state institutions against each other, bringing some into disrepute while pushing almost all of them into the vortex of political controversy. This is leading to national chaos. Several developments in recent days attest to this.\nTo start with, an unseemly public spat took place between President Arif Alvi and the Election Commission of Pakistan. This was sparked by the question of who should set the date for elections to the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies, which were dissolved in January.\nPresident Alvi, acting in support of PTI’s demand for immediate dates,asked ECP to announce datesright away. If it failed to do so it would be responsible for violation of the Constitution. He then invited the chief election commissioner for consultation. ECP declined saying the matter was sub judice. In a letter, it also objected to the language used by the president and said the commission was “well aware of its constitutional obligations”.\nThis did not stop the president fromunilaterally announcingApril 9 as the date for provincial elections. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharifslammed the moveas “illegal”, adding this wasn’t the first time Alvi had acted “unconstitutionally”. In response to the presidential announcement, ECP turned to the attorney general who said the president did not have this power.\nSoon after, the chief justice of the Supreme Court took suo motu notice of the matter, which he described as being of “high constitutional importance”. A nine-member bench was established to determine who has constitutional authority to fix the election date. Hearings began immediately with varying opinions expressed by SC judges.\n\nNever before in the country’s tortured political history has a public clash taken place between the two state institutions of the Presidency and ECP. The matter now rests with the Supreme Court but an unfortunate record has been set of two constitutional bodies in head-on collision — with the executive and Presidency also at loggerheads.\nThe root of this dispute lies in the ruling coalition’s obvious reluctance to hold provincial polls within the constitutionally stipulated 90-day period. This is evident from inaction by PDM-appointed governors in the two provinces and statements by federal ministers.\nEvery state institution is now caught in the cross hairs of the raging political storm.\nThe courts have now become a political battleground in the intensifying confrontation between the PDM government and Imran Khan’s PTI. Unable or unwilling to resolve political disputes themselves, the two contending sides take them to court, which is expected to act as an arbiter of politics rather than law. Then if verdicts do not suit or advantage a particular party, the courts are subjected to criticism and accused of bias.\nBoth sides seek to mount pressure on the courts. The dramatic manner in which Khanregistered his presencein the Lahore High Court last week, accompanied en route by thousands of supporters, aimed to do just this.\nMeanwhile, PML-N leaders continue to direct criticism at the courts accusing them of ‘double standards’. Maryam Nawazrailed against two serving judgesof the Supreme Court during an address at a party rally in Sargodha. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif took aim at the judiciary in parliament to ask whether court decisions in the past were based on political considerations or the public interest.\nA senior PPP leader accused the LHC of showing preferential treatment to Khan. Several judges have frequently counselled political leaders not to resort to the courts to settle political conflicts. But these entreaties have fallen on deaf ears. Taking political issues to the higher judiciary in fact distorts their role as well as makes them the subject of controversy. This risks undermining public trust in judicial institutions in an intensely polarised environment.\nThe pressure the power tussle is exerting on the courts is in fact quite unprecedented. It can even divide the higher judiciary. Already one Supreme Court judge hasquestionedwhether there was a basis for suo motu action on the election date issue.\nLegal counsel representing political parties now frequently object to the constitution of benches and name which judge should recuse himself from a case. Some members of the country’s legal fraternity fear open clashes within and between the higher judiciary in political cases they are dealing with.\nMeanwhile, former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa has been at the receiving end of bitter criticism at different times from both sides of the political divide. When Khan was in power, Bajwa faced criticism from PML-N leaders, who accused him of being behind former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s ouster and engineering Khan’s election victory in 2018.\n\nSince Bajwa’sretirementit has been Khan’s turn to accuse the ex-army supremo of conspiring to remove him and imposing a “corrupt PDM government” on the country. Scathing comments about Khan attributed to Bajwa by a journalist, who met him, further fanned this controversy and fuelled a war of words.\nKhanwrote to the president, as supreme commander of the armed forces, asking him to “institute an immediate inquiry” against Bajwa for violating “his oath of office”. Meanwhile PML-N leaders, seeking to exploit this, issued statements to breathe further life to the controversy.\nThe revelations in these bitter exchanges only confirmed the hybrid nature of the political arrangement that was in place during Khan’s tenure. But the involvement of the country’s former top general in such public controversy also has implications for the army’s reputation.\nObviously, what the former COAS did or didn’t do cannot be disassociated from his institution. The episode therefore casts a negative light on the institution’s role. Indeed, rarely before has the military establishment’s role — and responsibility for the country’s present political mess — been at the centre of so much public and media comment and critique.\nIt appears as if almost every state institution is now caught in the cross hairs of the political storm with its reputation being affected by this. This is pushing the country into uncharted territory where the standing, credibility and integrity of state institutions is increasingly being called into question. If public trust in institutions is eroded and their legitimacy undermined this will only leave the country in a more ungovernable state."}]}

The assemblies were dissolved in January but the PDM government, which installed caretaker administrations in the two provinces, prevented their governors from fixing a poll date.\nIn the face of this reluctance, consultations by the Election Commission of Pakistan went nowhere. When President Arif Alviannouncedan election date the government condemned this action while the ECP held back from doing anything.\nAgainst the backdrop of this confusion and uncertainty, the SC was obliged to step in and take suo motu notice of a matter which was of constitutional importance and had a time-bound nature. In a 3-2 verdict, the apex court directed the president to suggest a date for the Punjab poll and Governor Ghulam Ali a date for elections in KP after consultation with the ECP. If elections could not be held within 90 days, the ruling said, then ECP should propose a date that “deviates to the barest minimum” from that deadline. No sooner had the SC decision been announced when spokespersons of the ruling coalition began to question the judgement and deploy various arguments against it.\n\nThe most curious and legally bizarre interpretation came from the attorney general. He argued that the petition had actually been dismissed 4-3, as two judges had dissented from the verdict, while another two judges had earlier recused themselves from the hearing; that meant the ‘majority decision’ was not in support of the SC ruling and was, instead, in the government’s favour.\nThe federal law minister echoed this line in TV interviews claiming he was speaking in his personal capacity. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah claimed, equally disingenuously, that “The petition of PTI stands rejected and suo motu proceedings stand dropped in the light of the decision.”\nThe government only signalled its weakness by these interpretations as well as place itself in a potentially disadvantaged position if not on a collision course with the senior judiciary in the days to come. The debate and controversy it aimed to rake up did little to obscure the fact that the verdict was a setback for the ruling coalition, which just doesn’t want to go to the polls.\nLast month, when the Lahore High Courtordered the ECPto consult the PDM-appointed governor, Baligh ur Rahman on the poll date, he challenged this and went into an intra-court appeal. Subsequently, ECP too filed a similar appeal.\nFresh elections are the only means to escape from the political quagmire.\nThe ruling coalition now has little choice but to implement the SC judgement, which is legally and constitutionally binding. ECP moved to comply with the order by writing to President Alvi proposing Punjab polls can be held between April 30 and May 7.\nAlvi hasapprovedApril 30 as the election date. If the government refuses to comply with the SC ruling it will be defiance of the apex court, which will lay it open to contempt proceedings.\nThe ruling coalition can now either comply reluctantly or in a way that shows leadership and responsibility. Although it is loath to engage with opposition leader Imran Khan, who also refuses to talk to the government, it should make an effort to reach out to him and see if a mutually acceptable date for general elections can be agreed.\nIf the effort succeeds, for which Khan would also have to show uncharacteristic flexibility, national and provincial elections can be held simultaneously, on the same day, the way they always have in the past.\nThe SC even offered this opportunity when during the proceedings it asked the legal counsel of both political parties to consult with their leadership on a consensus date. But this opportunity was not seized by political leaders. Although time is short, if agreement on simultaneous elections can still be reached by the warring sides the SC can be approached and conveyed the commonly agreed date. The court will likely sanction such an outcome.\nOn the other hand, in the absence of an accord, an anomalous situation would be created if provincial elections in Punjab and KP are held in April and national polls in, say, October/November, after the National Assembly completes full term in August.\nThat would mean that there will be elected and not neutral caretaker governments in place when general elections take place. The spirit behind Article 224 1-A of the Constitution would be defeated. This enjoins the government and opposition to agree on installing caretaker governments to oversee elections. More legal challenges can then be expected on this issue before general elections are anywhere near.\nThere are other more consequential political implications of holding provincial and general elections on different dates. The PDM government, seeking to delay national polls, seems to overlook the fact that if PTI was to do exceptionally well in the provincial elections, this would set the template for general elections. Khan would have the political momentum with him to take his party more easily past the winning post later.\nIf PDM parties feel they need to buy time to improve their electoral prospects, it defies logic as to how their position will change in any appreciable way in a few months. If anything, the government is losing political ground in the face of soaring inflation, sky rocketing energy and fuel prices and a worsening economy.\nIndeed, if ‘salvaging the economy’ was one of the key justifications for the PDM government to hang on to power, it is now wearing thin. The economy is in meltdown mode, the IMF deal remains elusive, the rupee is in freefall and market/business confidence is hitting an all-time low. International rating agencies have again begun to warn that Pakistan might default on its sovereign debt.\nThe finance minister’stypically angry responsedoes nothing to calm markets. With the political and economic crisis posing a mounting challenge to the country’s stability, elections and a fresh mandate may be the only way out of the present quagmire."}]}

What has this period meant for the country? How has it shaped politics and affected governance? For a start, the ruling coalition has little to show by way of improved governance.\nIt has instead been defined by its bloated cabinet — the largest in the country’s history. The appointment of a legion of ministers and special assistants — that too for a short-duration government and many without portfolio — had little to do with the needs of governance but everything to do with rewarding friends and allies for their political support.\nThe ruling coalition has lacked any policy aim or direction. It has been a rudderless affair for much of the past year, with Sharif unable to make the transition from a provincial to a national leader adept at running federal affairs.\n\nHis modest communication skills also laid bare his limitations while his previous reputation as a ‘doer’ has not been in evidence during his premiership. Instead, decision-making has been marked by vacillation and dithering, most consequentially on the economic front.\nThechangeof finance ministers a few months into the government’s tenure came at a heavy price — delay in the IMF’s loan programme. This compounded the economic crisis and drove the economy to the brink.\nMeanwhile, PML-N’s main alliance partner in government, the PPP, purposively showed no interest in economic policy in an obvious effort to distance itself from the tough, unpopular economic measures the PDM government was obliged to take for a Fund bailout.\nFor PML-N, its failure, despite several efforts, to gain control of the Punjab government (until the provincial assembly’s dissolution in January) was one of its biggest political setbacks. Its poor performance in a series of by-elections in Punjab demonstrated that its position in its traditional and only provincial stronghold had dramatically weakened.\nBeyond these setbacks and the PDM government’s underperformance, what did this period mean for the country’s politics? An overarching aspect of these months of political crisis, natural disaster and upheaval was the deepening polarisation in the country.\nWhen calamities strike, they usually unite nations. But the worst floods in the country’s history did not persuade political rivals to temporarily cease their squabbles and offer a unified response to the catastrophe.Politics was back to businessas usual save for a few days after the deadly monsoon began to wreak unprecedented devastation across the country. With opposition leader Imran Khan on the warpath, no effort was made by either side to ease tensions then, or later.\n\nThe intensifying confrontation between the government and opposition kept the country in an unsettled state of uncertainty, with deleterious consequences for an economy in the critical ward.\nThe PDM government seemed directionless and its dithering exacerbated the economic crisis.\nAnother aspect of the post-April 2022 period was the absence of any serious or sober debate among political parties on the multiple challenges facing the country. In fact, a ‘new normal’ took hold in the political culture. Argument was replaced by invective, and civility by toxic rhetoric as the political discourse plunged to an unprecedented low.\nPolitical rivals daily exchanged inflammatory statements as if engaged in a terminal conflict. This obviated any meaningful discussion of policy issues, much less generated solutions to the country’s problems.\nAnother unfortunate trend in this period was that state institutions became the target of partisan attacks in the raging political battle. Criticism of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) by Khan and his party was frequent and virulent with the chief election commissioner being constantly asked to resign. PML-N leaders for their part, oftentaunted President Arif Alvifor compromising his office’s neutrality.\nThe senior judiciary was criticised at different times by all the major parties. This was an inevitable consequence of party leaders taking their political disputes to the court and then assailing courts when decisions didn’t go their way. The military establishment too came under unprecedented pressure and faced mounting criticism from political leaders for either intervening in the political game or not intervening on their side.\nWhether it was the establishment, judiciary or ECP, if their decisions or actions were seen as favourable for a political party, they were applauded. When the opposite happened, they were accused of being biased.\n\nThe most consequential development in this period was the deteriorating state of the economy and the inability of the PDM government to manage the situation competently. While the economic crisis was the cumulative result of years of dysfunctional economic policies, mismanagement of public finances and political instability, the government’s dithering and indecision exacerbated the crisis.\nForeign exchange reservesdwindledto a precarious level, inflation soared to a 50-year high, the rupee lost record value against the dollar, exports fell and remittances from overseas workers declined. With foreign debt at a record high and the external financing gap unbridgeable in the absence of new inflows, the risk grew of a sovereign default. International rating agencies downgraded Pakistan’s credit rating to junk status, highlighting the high level of default risk.\nAssurances by the finance ministerof having the situation under control were increasingly discounted by the market and business community. His frequent public references to the Fund for being “unfair”, “unreasonable” and acting “abnormally” hardly had a calming impact on nervous markets. Meanwhile, procrastination over prior actions needed to conclude the agreement with the IMF came at an increasing cost to the economy.\nThis was reflected in depleting reserves, falling exports and the precipitous erosion of market confidence. The Fund’s insistence on undertaking all reforms as prior actions had much to do with the lack of confidence in the government’s economic managers.\nOne year of PDM rule has been a lost opportunity in many ways, but also in the lack of effort made to forge a consensus on an agreed date for simultaneous provincial and national elections.\nNotwithstanding Khan’s inflexibility, it was the government’s responsibility to try to evolve such an agreement to calm down the situation and end the uncertainty. In the absence of this, the country’s political and economic future appears more troubled than ever."}]}

Long-standing regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iranagreed to restore bilateral relationsafter seven years of bitter confrontation and a diplomatic hiatus. The deal was signed in Beijing, which mediated the agreement.\nIn the joint trilateral statement, the two countries pledged to respect the “sovereignty of states” and “non-interference in the internal affairs of states”. They agreed to revive their 2001 security cooperation pact and renew their general cooperation agreement of 1998, which ranges over trade, economy and investment.\nThe breakthrough followed several days of talks in China, which were preceded by two key high-level visits — by Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi to Beijing in February 2023 and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s trip to Saudi Arabia in December 2022. These summit-level meetings and Saudi-Iranian exchanges in the region laid the necessary groundwork for the March 10 agreement.\nThe thaw in Saudi-Iran relations is a potential game changer for the region — provided it gathers steam and lasts. It has far-reaching implications for the Middle East and beyond, which could pave the way for a more stable and peaceful region. Both countries had strong motivations to seek détente.\nIran’s interest was to break out of the diplomatic isolation imposed on it by the US-led West. It was also deeply apprehensive about the likelihood of Saudi-Israeli diplomatic relations being established at Washington’s prodding and behest. That would have deepened Tehran’s isolation and gravely aggravated its security challenges.\nThe Saudi motive emanated from its security anxieties over escalation in tensions with Iran. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has faced several attacks including on its oil facilities and infrastructure. Over half of the kingdom’s oil production was affected by a missile and drone attack on its oil-processing installations in 2019, for which Riyadh blamed Tehran.\nFor Riyadh, reduced tensions with Iran aims to address these security threats. Other factors have also been at work. America’s diminished diplomatic and military footprint in the Middle East as it switched focus to its strategic priority of countering China as well as strained relations between the Biden administration and the Saudi leadership seemed to convince Riyadh that Washington was no longer a reliable or consistent ally, much less a guarantor of its security.\nThe agreement is a tentative first step towards détente but it can pave the way for a more stable region.\nDomestic considerations also figured prominently for the Saudi government which is pursuing an ambitious Vision 2030 plan that envisages diversifying the economy and enhanced spending on infrastructure and social sectors to make the country a global investment hub. Its domestic reform agenda urges lowering of regional tensions and a stable and predictable environment.\nUnder Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia has not only seen significant reforms in the country but also initiatives abroad that have set a new direction for its foreign policy.\n\nIt has moved to mend ties with Qatar and Turkiye. And it has shown it can distance itself from Washington, which has prompted many experts to note that MBS is pursuing a foreign policy increasingly independent of the West.\nThe rapprochement has raised the question of how this will affect conflicts, proxy wars and issues in the region on which the two countries have been at loggerheads, especially Yemen but also Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. Will de-escalation follow on these regional fronts?\nIf the two countries are able to implement their new understandings, it is likely that the sources of regional instability are reduced. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saudcast the agreement as indication of his country’s emphasis on “political solutions and dialogue”. Progress in talks on Yemen could be the first test of whether a peace dividend can result from the rapprochement.\nOf course, this is only a tentative, opening act of a challenging process. Détente after all is a process, not an event. There are many questions about the follow-up and scope of the reconciliation. Is it tactical? Will it endure? Can decades of mistrust be overcome?\nWill they be able address each other’s security concerns? Will the West try to undermine the deal? Can the two countries deal with underlying issues and transcend the Shia-Sunni schism that has historically been a driver of their enmity? Comments in the Saudi media have focused on whether Iranian behaviour would change to make détente meaningful.\nChina’s role is seen as critical. According to Faisal Abbas, editor in chief of Arab News, China as guarantor of the agreement has a high stake in ensuring that the détente makes headway.\nIn fact, China has scored a major diplomatic victory by its mediation. It has demonstrated its growing global influence and established itself as a major player in the Middle East. China is the biggest trading partner of both countries and, unlike the US, has good relations with both to play peacemaker. The region accounts for 40 per cent of China’s oil imports which underlines its stakes in the region.\nOn the other hand, the US has been diplomatically marginalised by the development — for now. Its effort to isolate Iran has suffered a major setback at a time of rising tensions between Washington and Tehran over Iran’s nuclear programme.\nThe US plan to normalise Saudi-Israel relations has also been scuttled for the immediate future. Israel faces a major reversal in seeking to build a regional coalition against Iran. Israel’s former prime minister Naftali Bennett called the agreement a “serious and dangerous” development and a “fatal blow to the effort to create a regional alliance” against Iran.\nWashington’s muted response indicates its unease and concern over the rapprochement. Many Western commentators however saw the thaw for what it is. Peter BakerwroteinThe New York Timesthat the Chinese-brokered deal had “upended US diplomacy in the Middle East”.\nJeffrey Feltman, a well-respected former senior UN and US official, was quoted in news reports as saying the agreement “will be interpreted — probably accurately — as a slap at the Biden administration and as evidence that China is the rising power”.\nMany tests lie ahead for the rapprochement to gather momentum but for now it holds the hope of regional powers seeking regional solutions to their disputes."}]}

They involve dealing with recurrent economic crises, providing effective governance, defeating terrorism, making education accessible to all its children and generating jobs to absorb the population’s youth bulge to avert a potential demographic disaster. The implications of these internal challenges for national security are apparent and can be ignored only at great peril to the country.\nBut external security challenges have been no less imposing since the country’s inception, confronting it with enduring dilemmas. The burden of history and tyranny of geography — a volatile neighbourhood and the headwinds of geopolitics unleashed by big power competition — have consistently put security from external threats at the top of Pakistan’s national agenda. Contested borders inherited from colonial rule compounded this dilemma.\nFew books have been written by Pakistanis about how the country’s enduring external security predicament motivated its quest for a nuclear capability. Feroze Khan’s Eating Grass was the first to chronicle Pakistan’s nuclear history and the challenges it faced to acquire a nuclear weapons capability.\nThe book’s concern with how Pakistan surmounted numerous obstacles to master the nuclear fuel cycle left a gap in the role of diplomacy and how its diplomats defended the country and promoted its interests in the nuclear domain.\nA compelling new book now fills that gap. The Security Imperative: Pakistan’s Nuclear Deterrence and Diplomacy by Zamir Akram, deals with nuclear diplomacy with sharp insight and extraordinary breadth. Having dealt first-hand with nuclear issues and negotiations, Akram, an outstanding diplomat, is especially qualified to tell the definitive story of Pakistan’s quest for security by acquiring credible nuclear deterrence in which diplomacy played a crucial role.\nPakistan’s main challenges lie within but external security has also posed enduring dilemmas.\nThe main theme of his well-researched book is the security-driven nature of Pakistan’s nuclear deterrence. In the opening chapter, Akram describes how the country’s security compulsions were the consequence of history and geography. The legacy of disputes and hostility with India shaped its security paradigm.\nPakistan initially relied on an external balancing strategy including military alliances to assure its security. But this failed to prevent India’s aggression in 1971. That together with the 1974 Indian nuclear explosion convinced Pakistan to seek a nuclear capability as a security guarantor. Geography worsened Pakistan’s security predicament given its location in an unstable neighbourhood with challenges emanating from Afghanistan.\nA key theme in the book is the discriminatory treatment meted out to Pakistan by the US-led West and how Pakistan’s diplomacy navigated through this while protecting and advancing its nuclear and missile programmes. Akram recalls how after India’s 1974 nuclear explosion the US ended up punishing Pakistan for what India had done.\n“Through a series of legislative measures such as the Glenn, Symington and Solarz amendments, the US effort was essentially to prevent Pakistan from pursuing its own nuclear weapons capabilities.” Pakistan’s civilian nuclear cooperation agreements were cancelled under American pressure, first with Canada and then the Reprocessing Plant agreement with France. Thereafter Pakistan had to pursue a covert nuclear weapons programme.\nPakistan used the period of its close relationship with the US following the 1979 Russian invasion of Afghanistan to build its nuclear capability, capitalising on what Akram calls the “strategic space” provided by this development.\nSo long as it didn’t conduct a nuclear test, make a weapon core and share technology, US pressure was kept at bay, he writes. Waivers on American non-proliferation laws and adherence to the “tacit understanding” enabled Pakistan to receive assistance and also move forward to build its capabilities.\nBut no sooner had the Russians been forced to withdraw from Afghanistan when the US imposed sanctions on Pakistan in October 1990 under its Pressler law. Islamabad protested, pointing out that unilateral measures aimed only at Pakistan would not promote regional nonproliferation. It also pressed on with its nuclear plans, conducting “cold tests” and shifting from its uranium-based nuclear weapons capability to the plutonium route.\nAkram outlines the diplomatic initiatives taken by Pakistan in the 1990s, offering a series of regional nonproliferation proposals to the US and India.\nIn the chapter ‘Roller Coaster’, he describes developments in which I was also intimately involved in our nuclear diplomacy as Pakistan’s ambassador to Washington. Pakistan-US relations had then plunged into crisis which only eased after prime minister Benazir Bhutto came to power, undertook an official visit to Washington and was able to convince president Bill Clinton that Washington needed to reassess its policy because its punitive approach had not worked. Clinton was to later publicly acknowledge that it was unfair to keep both Pakistan’s money and the F-16s it had paid for.\nIt was then that Senator Hank Brown informed me — as mentioned in the book — that he intended to move an amendment to the Pressler legislation to lift the ban on economic assistance to Pakistan and release all embargoed military equipment including the F-16s. Between then and the success of the Brown Amendment, for which the Pakistan Embassy lobbied hard, the Clinton administration tried to secure a unilateral nuclear concession from Pakistan in return for supporting the amendment.\nPakistan refused, including the proposal to “cap” its nuclear weapons programme in exchange for release of the F-16s. I was present in meetings during the visit of army chief Gen Waheed Kakar to Washington when he flatly told the Americans that as “Pakistan’s national security was non-negotiable” they could keep the planes. In the end, the Brown Amendment was adopted, economic sanctions lifted and military equipment worth $368 million was released except the F-16s.\nAkram details the talks between the US and Pakistan before and after Pakistan’s nuclear tests that followed India’s in 1998. Later chapters again pick up the theme of nuclear discrimination, discuss the 2005 Indo-US nuclear deal and the implications for Pakistan of this “nuclear exceptionalism”.\nPakistan’s response and plan to achieve ‘full spectrum deterrence’, announced in 2011, is also appraised with clarity. Accounts of Pakistan’s bilateral and multilateral nuclear diplomacy contain many useful insights. Important as the nuclear capability has been to provide Pakistan with the means to deter external aggression, an important conclusion of the book is that nuclear deterrence cannot deal with internal challenges which Pakistan is facing. That in turn can weaken deterrence."}]}

Yes, in many respects, today’s political turmoil and crisis have strong echoes of the past. Government-opposition confrontations have been frequently witnessed before. So, too, has lack of tolerance between political opponents, who view each other not as rivals but enemies to vanquish in a war.\nArrests of opposition members, cases against political leaders and repressive steps to quell protests are wearingly familiar. Clashes between the president and executive are also a throwback to past tussles. Courts have long been called on to arbitrate political disputes, with their rulings often becoming controversial. The military establishment’s role in backing one political side against another is hardly new.\nNor is its outsized role in the political arena, despite its claims to the contrary. Power plays by state institutions that pitted them against one another have been a recurring feature of the country’s tortuous history. As have efforts to curb media freedom.\nMany people in the country believe that as we have been here before, there is little to be overly concerned about. This too shall pass. After all, every time a way was found out of crisis, even if it left democracy weaker. The trouble with this rather complacent view is that it overlooks the fact that Pakistan today is very different, with objective conditions having fundamentally changed.\nThe country faces formidable challenges in a deeply divided and politically fractured state. Several overlapping crises — political, economic and constitutional — are reinforcing each other, while a resolution of the political crisis, the key to unlocking others, is nowhere in sight. Worse, it isn’t clear what solution would work and be acceptable to various stakeholders.\nThe first aspect of the situation today that sets it apart from the past is the sharppolarisationin the country. This is unprecedented despite Pakistan’s record of divisive politics. Never before have people, society and state institutions been so divided by their partisan preferences and resistance to countenance a view other than their own.\nPolarisation and a zero-sum attitude have eliminated the middle ground, making it harder if not impossible to reach a compromise to end the political battles endangering the country’s stability.\nThis is happening when Pakistan faces the most seriouseconomic crisisin its history. To be sure, the country has confronted financial crises several times before. This compelled it to repeatedly seek IMF bailouts, making it the world record holder in the number of Fund programmes it has had — 23. But there are at least three ways in which the current economic crisis is a departure from the past. Thanks to decades of fiscal profligacy, Pakistan is so deeply mired in debt that it has to keep borrowing more to repay previous loans.\n\nIts external financing requirements have risen so much that conventional bailout packages hardly give it any breathing space and further injections are perpetually needed. This situation will only worsen until the country secures debt relief, for which it needs a credible, reformist government.\nPolitical brinkmanship is driving the situation out of everyone’s control.\nThe second aspect of the economic crisis is that friendly countries Pakistan has relied on for funds now seem fatigued and overburdened by its ‘requests’. This is evidenced by delay in their financing commitments coming through. That, in turn, has delayed the deal with the IMF, with whom the trust gap has widened.\nMoreover, Pakistan’s geopolitical ‘relevance’ has diminished in the West’s perception, lowering its stake in the country’s future. The third aspect of the current economic challenge is the cost-of-living crisis, fuelled in part by external factors. Never before did Pakistan have to deal with a public finance crisis in such an adverse global financial environment. Soaring inflation and energy shortages are fuelling widespread public discontent, that can erupt into unrest any time, with consequences for its stability.\nThe present also differs from the past in greater youth activism in politics. The political impact of the country’s youth bulge is now palpable and evidenced by their participation in rallies and protests by political parties, especially those organised by PTI.\nTrue, students played a prominent part in past political movements, usually through traditional vehicles like student organisations and unions. But youth activism today is more-broad based and expresses itself in support for the brand of populist politics represented by Imran Khan. This has obvious electoral implications. Over 44 per cent of the electorate, around 55 million, are young voters between 18 and 35 years of age. If youth activism translates into votes at the ballot box, it could be a game changer that can determine the outcome of the next election.\nMeanwhile, technology has created a more informed and connected citizenry, while social media today is another new factor shaping the political environment. This means traditional methods by which the government or establishment controlled or determined the narrative no longer work. While the electronic media is often subjected to government controls, social media cannot be restricted. It has become a mobilising vehicle that taps into and galvanises public sentiment and shapes opinion.\n\nFinally, there are now limits to the political influence exercised by the military establishment. In the past, it found political allies with fairly strong bases of public support and some credibility to use as countervailing forces against political leaders/parties it sought to exclude from politics or government.\nThis also enabled it to ‘tilt’ electoral outcomes in their favour, as witnessed during the 1990s.\nBut today, the two traditional parties available for this purpose are in secular decline and shadows of their former selves. That is why one of them is so afraid of elections in its previous regional stronghold. Without credible, strong political partners, the establishment is unable to use its old playbook, because its political leverage is also not what it once was.\nWhat does this all mean? It means the country is now in uncharted territory, with a high degree of unpredictability. This makes it hard to gauge where it might end up, as the past is now a poor guide. It suggests that traditional means of crisis management and ensuring political outcomes may not work. As a result of political brinkmanship, the situation can spin out of everyone’s control and drive the country to the edge of an implosion."}]}

As widely expected, the SCorderedelections to the Punjab Assembly to be held on May 14, declaring unconstitutional and illegal the Election Commission’s decision to postpone the polls to October. It also instructed the government to provide funds to the ECP and assure security for the provincial poll. The SC judgement upheld the Constitution even if the procedure it adopted provoked controversy and criticism. The legal community generally welcomed the verdict while expressing dismay over the internal divisions exposed in the process.\n\nThe ECPmoved to execute the SC orderby issuing an election schedule. But the ruling coalition ‘rejected’ the verdict and vowed not to implement it. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif struck a defiant note in the National Assembly calling the judgement a “murder of justice”. The law minister warned it would worsen the political and constitutional crisis. PML-N called on the chief justice to resign. So did its alliance partner, PPP. Heads of the ruling coalition declared the apex court’s decision would be “resisted” in all forums including parliament. The assembly then adopted a resolution against the SC’s ruling and urged the prime minister not to comply with it. It also asserted that provincial and general elections should be held at the same time.\nSince thePunjab and KP assemblies were dissolvedby the opposition in January the PDM government did all it could and deployed every alibi to avoid giving a date for elections. The ECPfixed Oct 8as the date for the polls, which was then challenged in the apex court. Even before the ruling, Sharif and his ministers went on the offensive to subject the chief justice to pressure and insist on a full court bench to hear PTI’s petition.\nWith the government’s declaration of non-compliance with the Supreme Court’s decision, the two are set on a collision course. This compounds the political chaos in the country and the already fraught situation created by institutional clashes — between the executive and presidency, between the SC and ECP and now both the executive and legislature at loggerheads with the judiciary. All this is a consequence of the fierce power struggle between the PML-N-led coalition and Imran Khan. Their confrontation has turned these institutions into political battlegrounds. Political disputes have assumed the form of legal battles. Issues, including the election date, that should have been resolved by dialogue and mutual accommodation between political leaders, landed in courts, placing them under unprecedented pressure. And when courts gave their rulings one or the other side accused them of bias and partisanship.\nA more dangerous and unpredictable phase of the escalating political crisis is unfolding.\nWhat does all of this mean for Pakistan’s democracy? The political deadlock and breakdown of politics — when political disputes are no longer resolved by political means — have left democracy in a dysfunctional state. Democracy requires give and take, compromise and consensus to make it work. But when polarisation and searing divides make this elusive if not impossible, democracy is undermined. Toxic politics and extreme intolerance has created an environment inimical to democracy and is eroding any semblance of a democratic culture.\nWith PTI’sunwise decisionfor its lawmakers to resign from the National Assembly, parliament’s lower house is opposition-less and has become dysfunctional as a result. Moreover, the ruling coalition has hardly used it for legislation in the public interest. Instead, it has become a vehicle for the government in its political war, and is now being used against the judiciary. The resolution rejecting the SC verdict and aggressive speeches denouncing it in the assembly is testimony of this. All this has denuded parliament of its real role in a democracy.\n\nThe essence of democracy lies in strong institutions whose independence and decisions are respected by all political actors. But today, with state institutions in the vortex of the raging political conflict they are increasingly riven by internal divisions (Supreme Court) with their decisions being contested. How differences among judges of the apex court play out may have lasting implications for its credibility. As for the ECP, which stepped beyond its mandate and committed a constitutional transgression, its role has made it the object of public controversy. If these institutions serve as the infrastructure of democracy, their erosion and lack of cohesion, for one reason or another, leaves democracy weakened. Polarisation and political turmoil are taking their toll on the country’s institutions and exposing them to the risk of breakdown. The government’s intent now to undermine the SC’s authority and legitimacy by its virulent attacks, refusal to abide by its decision and mobilise its supporters among the legal fraternity, will only undermine the rule of law, which is the bedrock of democracy. Equally, defiance of the law and Constitution will push the country on the road to disorder and chaos, and eventually entail a political cost for the PDM parties.\nThis conduct, the unremitting political maelstrom as well as stand-off between the pillars of state pose a rising threat to Pakistan’s fragile democracy. The unmistakable signal it sends to the people who are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis in a deteriorating economic environment is that the political leadership is concerned more with power than public purpose. What is in progress is ferocious intra-elite competition that has little if anything to do with public needs or the public welfare.\nA bigger crisis with unpredictable consequences seems inevitable with the PDM government refusing to implement the Supreme Court decision. This is unprecedented in the country’s history. Growing public disquiet over the situation is reflected in an opinion poll conducted by the consultancy firm, IRIS communications. This finds over 70 per cent of respondents feel the country is going in the wrong direction. Meanwhile, Imran Khan haswarnedhis supporters will take to the streets if the government doesn’t comply with the judicial order. This promises more unrest and instability ahead with greater damage to democracy. It also risks reducing democracy to a mere shell shorn of substance."}]}

The prolonged diplomatic imp­asse persists, characterised by new irritants that have added to long-standing disagreements and disputes. When India, host of this year’s G20 summit, announced holding aG20tourism working group meeting in Srinagar in occupied Kashmir, it provoked a sharp response from Islamabad.\nA foreign ministry statementdenounced the move, calling it “irresponsible” and describing it as designed “to perpetuate its illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir in disregard of UN Security Council resolutions”. It also objected to Delhi’s scheduling of two other meetings of a consultative youth affairs forum (Y20) in Leh and Srinagar. The All Parties Hurriyat Conference urged Muslim countries and China not to attend meetings in the disputed region.\nPakistan’s response was predictable in view of India’s aim to use these meetings to secure legitimacy for its actions by conveying a sense of normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir, which itillegally annexed and absorbedinto the Indian union in August 2019.\nIndia’s sweeping restrictions, military siege and human rights violations have continued to make the situation there dire. Delhi has also carried out legal, demographic, and electoral changes in the past two years to disempower Kashmiri Muslims. Pakistan’s protests have not deterred the BJP government from pressing ahead.\nFormal dialogue and the peace process between the two neighbours were suspended by India long before its 2019 action. But relations plunged to a new low after August 2019. Pakistan responded to Delhi’s Kashmir action by halting trade, recalling its high commissioner and downgrading diplomatic ties.\nHowever, back-channel communication between them led in February 2021 to re-commitment by both sides toobserve a ceasefireon the Line of Control in accordance with a 2003 understanding. From the dangerous confrontation during the Balakot crisis of February 2019, the two countries stepped back from the brink to agree on the LoC truce.\nThe ceasefire has since mostly held. But expectations that this thaw would pave the way for a formal dialogue did not materialise. The diplomatic deadlock persists with strongly worded statements exchanged with regularity.\nOther than holding the G20 presidency this year, India is also chair of the eight-member Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and will host its annual summit in June. In that capacity it was obliged to invite Pakistan to the foreign ministers’ meeting in Goa scheduled for May 4-5.\nAlthough Islamabad has yet to take a decision on whether to attend, it has rarely shied away from participating in multilateral forums even when held in India. As for attending the heads of government summit in June, that might depend on whether Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin attend.\nThe impasse persists with new irritants being added to long-standing disagreements and disputes.\nThe more consequential development for Pakistan-India relations in recent months has been over the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960. For six decades, this has survived wars, confrontations and tensions between the two countries. But questions have now arisen over the fate of the treaty that governs the sharing and management of trans-border rivers.\n\nOn Jan 25, 2023, India notified Pakistan through the Indus Commission of itsintention to modifythe Indus Waters Treaty. This reflected a hardening of India’s position and an effort to take advantage of Pakistan’s preoccupation with its domestic political turmoil and economic crisis.\nPakistan has long disputed the construction of the 330 megawatt Kishanganga hydroelectric project on the Jhelum river and plans to construct the 850 MW Ratle Hydroelectric Project on the Chenab river in occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nThis dispute has figured for decades in bilateral talks and meetings of the Permanent Indus Commission. Because a resolution proved elusive, in 2016 Pakistan approached the World Bank, which brokered the treaty and is also a signatory, to appoint an ad hoc Court of Arbitration to deal with the dispute, a provision under the treaty.\nWhile India completed the Kishanganga project in 2018, the bank took six years to activate the court as well as a neutral expert, sought by India. Both dispute settlement methods are sanctioned by the treaty. Two days before the first court hearing at the Hague on Jan 27, which India boycotted, Delhi served notice on Islamabad that it would unilaterally amend the treaty citing Pakistan’s “intransigence in handling disputes”.\nThis indicated Delhi’s effort to avoid any court process and intent to bar third-party intervention in disputes by the proposed treaty modification. It asked Islamabad to respond in 30 days to its ‘notice’.\nPakistan rejected India’s call for negotiations on amending the treaty’s dispute mechanism and accused Delhi of trying to divert attention from arbitration proceedings at the Hague.\nBut in early April, Pakistan responded to India’s ‘notice for modification’ through a letter from the Commissioner for Indus Waters. This has not been made public. But officials say the letter seeks clarification on the ‘notice’, offers to listen to Delhi’s concerns and insists the treaty cannot be unilaterally amended.\nThis dispute over an issue of vital importance for water-stressed Pakistan has further vitiated the atmosphere. Even cricket has not escaped bilateral tensions. In September, it is Pakistan’s turn tohost the Asia Cup, under the Asia Cricket Council. The ACC president is Indian cricket board’s Jay Shah (son of BJP Home Minister Amit Shah). Without consulting the host country, Pakistan, Shah unilaterally announced a schedule for the tournament in January. When PCB chairman Najam Sethi protested at a board meeting in February, Shah conveyed India’s refusal to play in Pakistan.\nSethi said that by the same reciprocal criteria it would be impossible for Pakistan to later play in the World Cup in India. He offered a hybrid option with matches involving India played in a neutral venue and the rest in Pakistan, a formula that could later be applied to the World Cup. The matter is still unresolved.\nPakistan-India relations remain clouded in uncertainty. While working-level diplomatic engagement continues sporadically on practical issues, chances of any melting of the ice are remote. The prospect is for the two countries to continue in an uneasy state of no war, no peace. The near-term goal should be to manage tensions and prevent them from spinning out of control. But still lacking is any framework for the management of tensions."}]}

During the hearing on the election issue earlier this week, the court invited political party representatives and asked whether they could reach an agreement, in which case it would be prepared to show flexibility on its earlier order thatfixed May 14 for elections in Punjab.\nThe chief justice made it clear that “if political parties come together the court could make room for them and change the date for elections. If not, elections will be conducted on May 14”. The SC warned that time was running out to settle this dispute and it would not go back on its order for May 14 polls.\nThese developments came in the backdrop of rising public pressure for the ruling coalition and opposition to come to the negotiating table to end the political impasse. Many civil society organisations collectively called for talks. So did the business community through the Pakistan Business Forum. The media too has long been urging a national dialogue to break the gridlock.\nIt seemed a hopeful sign that senior representatives from many political parties showed up for the SC hearing in response to its call. Party leaders from the ruling coalition told the SC they were ready to talk to the opposition on the election issue. PTI leaders said they wanted elections, but this must be in line with the Constitution.\nThey expressed doubts about the government’s sincerity, pointing to the vitiation of the atmosphere by arrests of thousands of PTI workers. The Jamaat leader proposed calling elections after Eid and recalled that confrontation between PML-N and PPP had paved the way for martial law in the late 1990s. The hearing was adjourned till next week with coalition spokesmen claiming they will pursue dialogue after Eid.\nPolitical leaders should rise above partisan interests to forge agreement on the election date and code of conduct.\nWhether or not political dynamics will then be any different urging political rivals towards compromise, the signs are not encouraging. In press conferences after the SC hearing, leaders of some parties, including PPP, sent rather negative signals.\n\nEarlier, the Jamaat leader’s mediatory efforts confronted formidable though predictable obstacles. Imran Khan constituted a negotiating team, only for a PTI spokesman to dub the talks offer as a “joke” in view of the government’s actions. He also said there could be no talks without the establishment — the ‘real decision-maker’.\nFor their part, PML-N and its coalition partners spent more time on political manoeuvres to circumvent the Supreme Court order on Punjab elections than directing their energy to dialogue.\nIn recent weeks, the government also stepped up confrontation with the judiciary. In its ruling of April 4, the apex court had instructed the Election Commission to secure funds from the government to hold provincial elections on May 14.\nBut the government ensured through a series of legislative moves for parliament to reject any allocation of funds. Despite three SC directives for release of funds to the ECP the government refused to comply.\nThis defiance put PDM on a collision course with the SC but the government cast this battle as one between parliamentary authority and a court overstepping its mandate. Combative rhetoric by PML-N ministers against the CJP including accusations of “misconduct” seemed designed to pressure him to step down. But this was in vain. For his part the CJP warned the government’s “failure to provide funds could have serious consequences”.\nIt is now for the government to show leadership and try to reach an accord with the opposition on a common date for elections. Under the Constitution, the National Assembly will stand dissolved in August, which means the coalition government has just about four months left in its term.\nThis should be reason enough for it to offer a compromise to end the election dispute, which has produced unseemly clashes between state institutions and exacted a heavy toll on an ailing economy.\nTo continue to play for time makes little sense. If the coalition government sought time to weaken Khan, that hasn’t happened. In fact, multiple cases filed against him have only helped to consolidate his political base and hardly affected his popularity.\nA consensus on when elections should be held is necessary because it would also help to facilitate agreement on the code of conduct and rules of the road leading to polls. In the absence of an agreement, the polarised and fraught atmosphere will make the electoral process highly contentious, even violent. There is every possibility that the losing side will not accept the election results. Pakistan already has an unedifying history in which almost every election result has been disputed.\nDuring the 1990s, PML-N and PPP took turns to accuse each other of winning through ballot fraud. In the 2013 polls when Khan’s PTI lost to PML-N, he called the election the “biggest fraud” in the country’s history. In the 2018 polls which Khan won, both PML-N and PPP accused his party of widespread rigging with the establishment’s help. This troubled background provides the most compelling case for pre-election political consensus.\nThe greatest risk of unrelenting confrontation between the government and opposition and ongoing institutional clashes is that they can propel the country towards a constitutional breakdown. This can have grievously destabilising consequences in the midst of an economic crisis.\nIt can be averted if political leaders acknowledge the risks, put partisan interests aside and reach an understanding on the election timing and how polls should be conducted. The post-Eid period will be a test of whether leaders can put the country’s interests before their own."}]}

Despite several high-level interactions with Kabul aimed at securing its cooperation to contain the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which resides in Afghanistan, little headway seems to have been made. This is evident from the continuing surge in attacks in Pakistan conducted by TTP from their safe havens in Afghanistan.\nThis was confirmed most recently by theMinistry of Defence reportsubmitted to the Supreme Court, which argued that the internal security situation wasn’t conducive to holding provincial elections in May. Although the report was not made public, news reports cited it as maintaining that the terrorist threat had increased because the environment in Afghanistan worsened after theTaliban’s return to powerin August 2021.\nIt also said that with Kabul unwilling to act against TTP, its regrouping in Afghanistan posed a greater threat to Pakistan. Islamabad’s growing frustration was reflected in Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s warning last month that Pakistan would strike terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan if the Taliban failed to take action against TTP.\nExpectations of Pakistani officials that the Taliban’ assumption of power would help Pakistan secure its western border proved to be mistaken. A year and a half of Taliban rule has, in fact, seen their relapse into past practices which have aggravated Pakistan’s security predicament and tested Islamabad’s patience.\nIt has also resulted in rising international criticism and disengagement from Kabul. This at a time when the UN is warning of worsening poverty conditions and declining international assistance.\nWhat has Taliban rule meant for Afghanistan’s people? How is Afghanistan being governed? Are the Taliban different from the past? If they are, in what way? How cohesive are they in power?\nA recently published book seeks to answer these questions and more. The Return of the Taliban: Afghanistan after the Americans left by Hassan Abbas explores whether the Talibanare making the transition from their old-world outlook to one in sync with today’s realities. The US-based author is no stranger to the issues his book delves into. The book builds on his previous work and is a useful addition to the growing literature on the Taliban.\nPakistan’s post-2021 experience exposes the limits of engagement without a clear strategy.\nIt starts with a story, which, however, has never been corroborated. Hassan claims that after theDoha peace deal, the beleaguered Afghan president Ashraf Ghani sought revenge on the US, who he believed was conspiring with his Afghan opponents to bring the Taliban’s chief negotiator Abdul Ghani Baradar to power. He did this by sharing critical security information with rival Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani enabling his faction to enter Kabul ahead of the others.\n\nMore importantly, the book offers a compelling account of the last days before Kabul fell, how the leadership fled the country and why the slew of infamous warlords aligned with Ghani gave up without a fight. He endorses the generally accepted view that an exhausted America, a corrupt Kabul government and demoralised Afghan forces all contributed to the Taliban’s return.\n“The reality is that the Taliban outlasted the Americans,” he writes. How swiftly the capital and the rest of the country fell to the Taliban is attributed to their covert outreach to influential tribes and groups to convince them to strike peace deals to avoid later reprisals. This showed how adept the Taliban were in the art of brokering surrenders.\nThe book divides its examination of the Taliban into three phases, pre-9/11 Taliban 1.0, post-2001 Taliban 2.0 and the birth of Taliban 3.0 with the start of talks in Doha. The more instructive part is the third phase with the Taliban faced with the imposing task of transitioning from an insurgent to a political group running a government.\nAbbas finds the Taliban adapting to their new reality of governing Afghanistan and, in certain sectors, even breaking from commonly held assumptions about them. “The Taliban,” he writes, “have proven to be pragmatic, but they refuse to make any policy adjustment which they think will threaten their internal cohesion or weaken their political base.” He also describes “the battle lines between the relatively pragmatic Taliban in Kabul and their highly conservative counterparts in Kandahar”. This he says is causing policy paralysis.\nDiscussing the challenge of internal cohesion, Abbas argues that jealousies and rivalries haven’t reached the stage of fractures but the risk looms. Parallel centres of power are contesting for control and influence but this hasn’t weakened the Taliban’s hold on power.\nThe division between hardliners and pragmatists persists, which also explains the broken promises to the international community. For now, he sees hardliners and ultraconservatives having the edge.\n\nThe disorderly nature of decision-making within the Taliban puts their future and that of the Afghan people at risk. Unless internal divisions are resolved, the Taliban will continue to repeat their past.\nBut as they struggle to maintain unity, Taliban leaders are cognisant of the need to provide effective governance and engage with the outside world to secure international help and recognition. This is reason enough for Abbas to urge the global community to engage with the Taliban to promote moderation and empower the pragmatists, especially as he discerns a difference between the ‘old’ and younger generation of the ‘new’ Taliban.\nThe book considers the TTP in some detail. Among the reasons the author ascribes to the Taliban’s reluctance to take action against the militant group is the fear its cadres might join Islamic State-Khorasan.\n“Disgruntled TTP members, after all, had initially formed the core of IS-K.” Discussion of IS-K leads the author to conclude that the Taliban may respond to this threat by reinforcing their ideological purity and reviving their more radical activities to weaken IS-K’s appeal.\nThe book’s call to engage the Taliban can hardly be disputed not least because the Afghan people should not be punished for what their authorities do. But Pakistan’s post-2021 experience lays bare the limits of engaging without a clear strategy.\nThe Taliban’s inability to address Pakistan’s security concerns and lack of responsiveness on other issues, including girls’ education, suggests engagement should involve a ‘tough love’ approach that raises the costs for the Taliban of their inflexible stance."}]}

PML-N leaders set a more belligerent tone this time, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif calling the talks an “exercise in futility”, while Javed Latif declared that negotiations with “a terrorist party” were impossible.\nThis prompted PTI leaders to question the government’s seriousness to engage in result-oriented talks. Moreover, government actions, notably the police raid on former Punjab chief minister Pervez Elahi’s Lahore residence, made the political atmosphere more tense and hardly propitious for negotiations.\nNevertheless, at one point in the government-opposition parleys it seemed some headway was made when the two sides agreed national and provincial elections should be held on the same day. This resulted from a show of flexibility by Imran Khan’s PTI, whose negotiators led by Shah Mahmood Qureshi, also agreed to neutral caretaker administrations to oversee the polls.\nThey went further, offering to help the government, which lacks a two-thirds parliamentary majority, to secure a one-time constitutional cover to shift the election date beyond the constitutionally stipulated 90-day period through an amendment.\n\nBut the talks broke down on lack of agreement on a common date for elections. Government representatives didn’t budge from their position of holding elections after parliament completed its full term in August, which meant not before October.\nThe PTI side proposed dissolving the Sindh and Balochistan assemblies in May for elections to be fixed for some time in mid-July. This was rejected by the government. Thus the ‘final’ round of talksended inconclusivelywith no indication that negotiations will resume.\nConsidering the government only has four months left in its term, offering to hold elections, say a month or two earlier, could have forged a national consensus to end the political deadlock, ease political tensions and create a peaceful pathway to the polls. But the ruling coalition squandered this opportunity by not opting for this course.\nIts obduracy on the election date is only explicable by its desire to delay the polls as long as possible out of fear that the electoral outcome will not be in its favour.\nWhat kind of difference a few months will make to the political fortunes of coalition parties is beyond comprehension. If anything, time has been working against them, with PML-N steadily losing political ground.\nFailure to reach an agreement means confrontation between the government and opposition will intensify with the risk of greater political turmoil ahead. Khan had warned that in the absence of an accord his party will go back to the Supreme Court and he will direct his followers to agitate in the streets.\nPTI thensubmitteda letter to the apex court informing it that “a solution within the Constitution” could not be achieved in talks with the government. It also asked the court to implement “in letter and spirit” itsearlier orderto hold elections in Punjab on May 14. For its part, the SC ‘clarified’ that its order remained “unchanged”.\nThe country will remain in a state of limbo if the ruling coalition continues to delay polls to cling to power.\nOne of the reasons cited by representatives of the ruling coalition for not conceding on the election date is that the government has a trade policy to announce and a budget to present. Whether or not this was an excuse there is no getting away from the fact that the government’s political distractions, tardy decisions and mismanagement have left the economy teetering on the brink of a breakdown.\nThe bailout deal with the IMF remains elusive for several reasons. The last sticking points include the Fund’s insistence that Pakistan fully fund the external financing gap for the remaining part of this fiscal year.\nThe gap is estimated to be around $3 billion after $2bn was apparently committed by Saudi Arabia and $1bn by UAE. Before concluding the agreement, the Fund also wants to evaluate the budget plans prepared by the government, with whom it has an obvious trust deficit.\nThe IMF deal has been delayed since November. This delay is continuing to impose a heavy cost on the economy. This is reflected in depleting foreign exchange reserves, tumbling exports and the virtual collapse of business confidence. The economy is, in fact, precariously poised with the fall in exports, decline in overseas remittances, inflation at a 60-year high and the rupee losing record value against the dollar.\n\nFurther delay in the Fund programme could plunge the precarious economy into a graver crisis. If anything, the dire economic situation makes elections necessary sooner rather than later, so that a government with a fresh mandate can deal with Pakistan’s worst economic crisis on a sustainable basis and not by band-aid measures.\nThis is especially so as the coalition government, instead of steering the shipwrecked economy to safer shores, seems to be expending more time and energy on political battles and power tussles.\nIt has now declared war on the Supreme Court. Ruling coalition ministers have been lashing out against court orders, exploiting divisions among its judges and characterising their confrontation with the SC as one designed to assert parliament’s supremacy.\nAt times their aggressive statements seem to suggest they are deliberately provoking the court to take action against them. This conduct seems aimed at discrediting the court to justify the government’s defiance of its order to hold provincial elections in Punjab.\nMeanwhile, the Election Commission hasfiled a petitionfor a review of the court’s order on the Punjab polls claiming the SC exceeded its constitutional jurisdiction in fixing a date, which it lacked the authority to do. These clashes between state institutions have left the governance system in disarray and on the verge of collapse.\nThere may still be a slim chance for government-opposition talks to be revived. Otherwise, the ruling coalition’s desire to cling to power as long as it can and delay elections will keep the country in a state of limbo and only kick the can down the road.\nFar from ending the ongoing political crisis, it will set the stage for an even bigger one later with more profound consequences for the country’s economic and political stability."}]}

Ensure the article presents a nuanced perspective on the subject, incorporates geopolitical insights, and maintains a formal, insightful tone."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "THE debate continues over the value and role of soft power in the conduct of foreign policy. It has long been acknowledged that international perceptions are consequential to a country’s standing and even its geopolitical clout in global affairs.\nThe evidence is compelling that when soft power is deployed as an integral part of a country’s diplomatic strategy, it pays rich dividends by building trust and influence. This, in turn, helps that country to more effectively promote its foreign policy goals. States that earn respect from their conduct benefit from a soft-power effect that enhances their global reputation.\nIn a recent article in the Financial Times, the well-respected journalist Janan Ganesh disputed this and claimed that the “once influential concept looks dated in a world where hard power counts ever more”.\nHe cited the example of countries such as Australia and South Korea, who had long relied on the projection of cultural attraction to build their reputation, but were now turning to hard power as a result of “the exigencies of sharing a region with China.” That meant returning to increased defence spending and loading up on the “lethal kit”. From this, he concluded that the world today is witnessing “if not the end of soft power as a useful concept, then a brutal exposure of its limits”.Softassets, he also wrote, can neither replace nor rival hard ones.\nBut soft power was never envisaged to replace hard power. It was always seen as supplementing hard power in a country’s strategy. It is, after all, one among a range of tools for a country to deploy in pursuit of its goals. It is not an either-or choice.\nAmerican scholar Joseph Nye, who introduced the notion of soft power, defined it as the ability to shape the preferences of others and achieve outcomes through “attraction” rather than coercion or economic incentives. True that he counterposed soft power, “the power of persuasion and co-option,” with the “power of coercion” represented by the hard power of military and economic strength. But by introducing the concept of “smart power”, he sought to correct the misperception that soft power was enough on its own to produce a successful foreign policy.\nFor Nye, smart power is the capacity to combine the resources of hard and soft power and deploy whichever one is judged more effective in a specific context. Arguing that a rigid approach can be counterproductive, he offered the example of several countries that successfully followed smart strategies. In his influential book, The Future of Power, he cited the case of China, where leaders invested in soft power and efforts to make the country more appealing to accompany the increase in its military and economic power.\nInternational perceptions are consequential for a country’s reputation and standing.\nIn fact, the conduct of big, middle and small powers today indicates that they all seek to complement their hard power resources by deploying soft power assets, which together help to enhance their clout and enable them to engage more effectively in international diplomacy.\nThis doesn’t at all signify “the end of soft power.” A country’s reputation and positive image continues to count and play a key role in the battle for influence. Global powers that possess substantial military and economic strength integrate soft power in their strategies, and spend generous resources on this as it helps to expand their influence.\n\nChina today is engaging in vigorous soft power projection. Its recent mediation of rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran has increased its soft power.  It is also stepping up efforts to shape the global narrative. Western nations have of course been successfully doing this for a much longer time.\nCountries such as Singapore and Qatar have also used soft power to secure significant weight at the global level; this has helped reinforce their economic strength. In fact, soft power assets are especially useful for small and middle countries, providing them the means to project their influence and increase their international outreach and standing in a crowded global environment.\nFor them, being ‘liked’ becomes a force multiplier, encouraging cooperation from the international community and often enabling them to punch above their weight.\nThe Global Soft Power Index 2023, put together by the London-based company, Brand Finance, places Singapore and Qatar at number 21 and 24 out of 121 countries evaluated in several metrics of soft power. The US is ranked number one (although it slipped in rankings during Donald Trump’s presidency due to his unilateralist and disruptive policies). China is at number five and Canada at number seven.\nPakistan has consistently figured among the bottom half of countries in these rankings, and is at 84 in the latest report.\nPakistan incurs reputational damage by being seen to be perpetually in crisis, which hardly creates positive international perceptions of the country. But crisis isn’t all there is to Pakistan. Every country has strengths and weaknesses. So does Pakistan. In fact, the country has many soft power resources. But successive governments have paid little, if any, attention to identifying them, much less incorporating them systematically into its international diplomacy.\nGiven Pakistan’s longstanding international ‘image’ problem, in part due to mischaracterisations but also because of on-ground realities, it is all the more essential for it to undertake soft power efforts to correct misperceptions, and, more importantly, to project its positive socioeconomic attributes and rich heritage of arts, civilisation, music and culture. This involves the country defining itself so that others, including its adversaries, do not misrepresent it or seize the narrative to its disadvantage.\nToday, narratives at the international level are shaped in large part by soft power strategies, especially as a hyperconnected and multipolar world offers unprecedented opportunities to influence multiple actors across the world — beyond governments.  But our policymakers remain shy of changing how we conduct our diplomacy when ‘nation branding’ is deemed to be so essential.\nThere is no reason for Pakistan not to do better in the Global Soft Power League by raising its diplomatic game. For this, it is necessary in the first instance for our officials to acknowledge the importance of soft power, identify the country’s soft power resources, and then imaginatively incorporate them in our foreign policy strategy and diplomacy."}]}

Violence and wanton destruction of government buildings and military property by PTI followers after their leader’s (temporary)arrest.\nAn angry protest demonstration by ruling coalition parties outside the Supreme Court, which called on the chief justice (CJ) to resign for ‘favouring Imran Khan’; some leaders even threatening “dire consequences” from any court action against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.\nThe overarching political reality today is resistance by political parties to play by the rules. For months the government-opposition confrontation has been so fierce and unrestrained that no longer are any rules respected by the warring sides. Meanwhile, the military, furious at allegations by opposition leader Imran Khan and vandalisation of army installations, lashed out at “politically motivated” attacks and pledged to bring the perpetrators of violence to justice under army laws.\nFor his part, Khan alleged a ‘planned conspiracy’ to defame his party and create the justification to ban PTI. When acrackdownwas launched against his party cadres and several members began to quit PTI, his tone softened but he still claimed he was being targeted to prevent his return to power. In another twist in the crisis, the Lahore High Court struck down decisions of the Election Commission and National Assembly Speaker on the resignations of 72 PTI lawmakers, who Khan then asked to return to parliament to protest there.\nThe raging political crisis has dragged all state institutions into the eye of a perfect storm. Polarisation has reached an unprecedented level, with any middle ground in politics eliminated as a consequence.\nEven a semblance of national unity lies shattered. With neither side willing to back down, the political system is broken and democracy imperilled by the no-holds-barred power tussle. Endless political turmoil has pushed the country to the edge of the abyss.\nThe authority of state institutions is being eroded in a no-holds-barred political battle.\nAll state institutions have come under assault. The ruling coalition defied the Supreme Court order on holding Punjab elections and made the chief justice the target of virulent attack to force him to step down. To pre-empt any contempt action by the court it is also planning a ‘reference’ for ‘misconduct’ against the CJ, as indicated by a resolution adopted by the National Assembly last week.\nThe government has also declared it won’t accept any verdict by the apex court, accusing it of being partisan. In its confrontation with the SC, it has wrapped itself in the principle of parliamentary supremacy, throwing the very notion of separation of powers out of the window. It also adopted legislation to curb the CJ’s powers.\n\nFor its part, the PTI leadership has questioned the military’s role with Khan hurling one allegation after another at the army leadership, including the accusation that it seeks to disqualify and eliminate him from politics. Such attacks prompted a predictably strong response from the military’s public relations wing.\nThe ongoing political crisis has also entailed unseemly clashes between institutions — the executive and parliament with the higher judiciary, the government with the presidency and the Election Commission with the Supreme Court. In each instance one institution has accused the other of overstepping its constitutional authority.\nWhen the pillars of state clash or come under attack by political leaders, then whatever the aim, the consequence is to bring their credibility into question and reputation into disrepute. This can involve lasting institutional damage which, as history has shown, takes a long time to undo.\nBy undermining public trust in institutions, political actors ignore its deleterious consequences. The authority of these institutions rests principally on their legitimacy. When this is undermined, whether intended or unintended, the state’s authority is eroded. And when brinkmanship rather than restraint is on display the entire edifice of governance is exposed to the risk of paralysis and breakdown.\nThis has important implications for economic governance, which is the core task of the state. The economy cannot be effectively managed in an environment where there is erosion of institutional authority and nonstop political turmoil.\nThe implementation of economic decisions, especially the tough decisions needed today, rests on public compliance and acceptance of the legitimacy of government actions in this regard. But in an atmosphere where all state authority is being challenged, economic decisions too come into public question. This can lead to weak compliance or non-compliance with policy decisions, which in turn can jeopardise economic recovery.\nAt a time when the worst economic crisis in Pakistan’s history needs to be seriously confronted the country can least afford the erosion of state authority. Already the political battle has proved to be a fatal distraction for the government, preventing it from taking timely and prudent decisions to avert an economic breakdown.\nHeightened political instability is exacting a heavy toll on the economy. The country remains on the verge of default while a cost-of-living crisis is creating conditions for possible public unrest down the road.\nIn this complex situation, questions are being raised by some quarters whether general elections, due in October, can be held in such a toxic and fraught atmosphere. There is certainly a need to bring down the political temperature and establish a modicum of calm for the peaceful conduct of elections.\nBut any move to postpone elections beyond the constitutionally stipulated timeframe will be a recipe for disaster and cause more, not less, political turmoil. In fact, announcing a date for elections is still the only way the country can extricate itself from the escalating political crisis, which is endangering both the economy and national unity.\nIdeally, a political ceasefire and minimum consensus is needed between rival parties and leaders on an agreed path to elections and rules for its conduct. But the failure of talks between the government and opposition have put paid to such an outcome. The widening crackdown against the opposition has now made any resumption of dialogue impossible.\nEven so, the only way out of the present political quagmire is for the government to put the country’s interests before its own and fix a date for elections, to enable people to decide who should govern them. In the absence of this, the country’s very future will be at stake."}]}

The international landscape has been fundamentally transformed by the dispersion of power more widely among states. This redistribution of global power is a dynamic process and continues apace, accelerated by economic and technological developments of the 21st century. The shift in economic power from the West to the rest is one of the defining features of the contemporary world. Multipolarity is an increasing reality. So too is the fact that in a diverse, complex and interconnected world even the most powerful countries cannot achieve outcomes on their own and need the help of allies.\nThe institutional architecture of the international system, however, remains the product of a specific historical era. International institutions — the Bretton Woods twins, IMF and World Bank, and the United Nations — created in 1944-1945, reflect the realities of that time. The structure and composition of the UN’s premier organ, the Security Council, reflect the historical arrangement reached 78 years ago by the victors of World War II. They became the five permanent members of the Council that has 10 non-permanent elected members. Possession of the veto power further buttressed the P5’s position and created an inequality that persists to date. Thus the UN body charged with primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and whose decisions are supposed to be binding remains anchored in the past.\nCalls for reform of the 15-member Council have been heard over the decades from countries across the world. Most recently, UN Secretary General António Guterresagain added his voice to these calls. Speaking at a press conference last week in Japan, on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit, he said it was time to reform both the Security Council and Bretton Woods institutions to align them with the “realities of today’s world”. These institutions, he added, reflect the power relations of 1945 and needed to be updated.\nIt isn’t as if efforts for reform haven’t been undertaken. Since 2009 talks have been going on to reform the Security Council in informal sessions of the General Assembly. The GA which created the intergovernmental negotiations process set the goal of comprehensive Council reform involving five equally important and interlinked issues. These are: categories of membership, veto, regional representation, size and working methods of an expanded Council, and the relationship between the Security Council and General Assembly.\nCountries agree on reform but fundamental disagreements persist on specifics.\nThere is general agreement among countries on reform and increasing the Council size, with more representation for developing states, especially Africa. But beyond agreement to make the Council more representative by additional non-permanent members and improving its working methods, consensus on other issues has been elusive. The question of veto continues to be a source of intense contention while convergence on other issues has emerged over the years. Dialogue has never broken down but fundamental differences persist, which continue to hold up reform.\nThe principal disagreement, mainly responsible for slow progress in decades-long negotiations, is between countries that aspire for permanent seats for themselves and others who oppose this and, instead, propose enlarging the Council by adding more elected, non-permanent members. This has put the so-called G4 — Germany, Japan, India and Brazil — at odds with the Uniting for Consensus (UFC) countries led by Italy and including Pakistan, Argentina, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Canada and other like-minded states. G4 countries support more permanent members as well as additional non-permanent seats, while asserting their claim to permanent membership ostensibly on grounds of their economic strength, political standing and contributions to the UN. They back each other for Council membership and have also secured support from some P5 countries. For example, the US and UK support Japan, Germany, Brazil and India for permanent membership. The common African position is support for expansion in both permanent and non-permanent categories. This is predicated on the view that the continent’s under-representation is an act of historical injustice, which should be addressed.\n\nThe UFC group, in which Pakistan has always played an active role, calls for comprehensive reform and seeks a Council that is more representative, accountable, democratic and effective by adding elected members who can counter-balance the power of the veto-wielding P5 countries. The UFC argues that the Council’s frequent deadlock and paralysis is due to discord and the clashing interests of the P5, which prevents it from playing the role expected of it and enjoined by the Charter. Adding more permanent members with veto powers will only compound this dysfunction, not end it.\nPakistan voices the position of other UFC countries by arguing that reform should not reinforce inequality and preserve privilege for a few, but give all member states, big, medium and small, a chance to serve on the Council by rotating elected seats. This would make the body more representative of the membership. Moreover, in the democratic era, reform should be in sync with the spirit of the age. The principle of election is the bedrock of democracy. That should also apply to Council reform. More elected members will make it more democratic and accountable to the general membership.\nThe G4 and UFC don’t just have divergent perspectives. They have conflicting visions about the nature and future of the UN. One vision seeks to accord privileged status to a handful of countries on the basis of ‘permanence’. The other wants to see the organisation embody the principles of democracy and representativeness and offer opportunities to all states to become Council members.\nAgainst this backdrop, the prospects for reform depend on how these and other differences are reconciled, which is by no means easy. Even if this can somehow be achieved, the process of reform will have other challenges to surmount. Reform requires the UN Charter to be amended. This involves the General Assembly adopting a resolution on reform by a two-thirds majority. And then, the amendment based on the resolution, has to be ratified by at least two-thirds of the UN membership as well as the five permanent members. All this makes reform a distant possibility even though a major push for it is anticipated at next year’s Summit of the Future."}]}

Coming on the back of opposition leader Imran Khan’s intensifying confrontation with the establishment, the violent protests of that day triggered a sequence of developments that led to a sweeping crackdown on PTI supporters.\nThe party also began to disintegrate as more and more of its leaders and former lawmakers started to quit — an orchestrated process that is still underway. The defecting members all spoke from the same script — condemning the vandalisation of military installations and disassociating themselves from a party they held responsible for the violence.\nThe ruling coalition mounted more pressure on Khan with ministers warning he could be tried in a military court for “masterminding” the May 9 riots and his party could even face a ban. A beleaguered Khan, now mired in multiple court cases, vehemently rejected this allegation.\nWhile condemning the mass arrests and coercive actions, which he claimed were forcing the exodus from his party, he nonetheless offered talks to the government in a dramatic reversal of his previous position.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, however, rebuffed the offer and ruled out dialogue with those he dubbed as “anarchists and arsonists who wear the garb of politicians but attack the symbols of state”.\nPTI’s disintegration has already begun to reshape the political landscape. While political alignments will likely be fluid until elections are finally called, it raises questions about what will be the electoral state of play down the road. A key question is where will PTI’s sizeable vote bank go?\nEfforts are on by Jahangir Khan Tareen to form a new party that is able to attract ‘electables’ who have deserted PTI, and offer a ‘third option’ to voters. A smart politician and dynamic entrepreneur, JKT will, however, need his disqualification to be legally overturned to play a pivotal role. It is, in any case, too early to say how successful he will be in launching a party, and more importantly, whether enticing ex-PTI members to join will mean they would bring PTI voters with them.\nThe country’s future is clouded by political uncertainty and a runaway economic crisis.\nThis puts the country’s electoral politics in a state of flux. Will the contest in Punjab — the battleground province that determines the national outcome — be a four-way fight, which ends up denying any party a majority at the centre and producing a hung parliament?\n\nWill PTI voters turn up at the ballot box if they see their party has been dismantled and their leader, with all the legal cases against him, has little or no chance of returning to power? This would have a significant bearing on the overall turnout figure, especially as young voters now constitute a large part of the electorate.\nIt is unlikely that PTI voters would be persuaded to support the two traditional parties, PML-N and PPP, even though the latter has attracted some defectors from south Punjab. After all, their support for Khan was predicated on rejection of these two old parties.\nCanJKT’s new partyappeal to them? What also has to be kept in view is that in the past voters punished candidates who switched party loyalties. If the PTI vote divides will that benefit one or other of the traditional parties in our first-past-the-post system?\nUncertainties abound, especially as no election date has yet been announced by the government. When that happens, and it cannot be delayed once parliament’s present term ends on Aug 16, electoral calculations will start determining political alignments and the picture will become clearer about the nature of the electoral contest.\nBut for now, none of the political parties seem interested in spending any time spelling out their policy programmes or vision for the country’s future. No party has offered any ideas about how to address the country’s many challenges. They remain engaged in a power struggle and efforts to subdue their political opponents rather than evolve policy plans for the future.\nIf uncertainty has become a defining feature of the country’s politics, what is certain is the precarious state of the economy. The economic slide has accelerated under the PDM government with all economic indicators continuing to worsen.\n\nThe country is still teetering on the verge of a sovereign default on its debt despite protestations to the contrary by the government. The bailout deal with the IMF remains elusive.\nThe prime minister recently spoke to the managing director of the Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, for resumption of the stalled programme. But the IMF has conveyed its inability to conclude a staff-level agreement unless Pakistan is able to arrange financing to fill the gap of $6 billion in its current account in this fiscal year, which ends on June 30. Reserves have plunged to just over $4bn that cover less than a month of imports, despite the curbs placed on them.\nThe government has sought to manage Pakistan’s worst balance-of-payments crisis by stop-gap measures such as imposing import controls. This has already produced severe economic contraction. The latest officially estimated GDP growth figure for the current fiscal year is 0.3 per cent compared to 6pc in the last fiscal year — but even this dismal number is contested.\nThe industrial sector contracted by 3pc, with many businesses shutting down, causing job losses and shortage of goods. The monster floods last year adversely impacted the agricultural sector, where growth has slowed down significantly.\nExports too have declined, in large part due to restrictions on imports and resultant shortage of raw materials. Meanwhile, inflation has hit the highest ever level and the rupee has lost record value against the dollar. With an eye on elections, the government now plans what officials call a ‘relief budget’ expected to include fiscally lax, populist measures. This will only compound the economic crisis.\nWith politics taking priority over the economy, the country is approaching an inflection point. Its future is clouded by continuing political uncertainty and a runaway economic crisis that needs decisive action and structural reforms to resolve. The question is whether Pakistan has the leadership that understands this and is able to prioritise the country’s interests over its own."}]}

That Taiwan remains a dangerous flashpoint in their confrontation was laid bare last week when there was anear collisionbetween a Chinese warship and an American Navy guided-missile destroyer. This underscored what many countries in Asia and beyond have long feared — an inadvertent drift into a conflict that neither side wants but may be unable to avert in a region bristling with heightened military activity.\nThis prompted an exchange of toughly worded statements between the top defence officials of the two countries. They used the platform of the Shangri La security dialogue organised every year by a London-based think tank in Singapore to send each other strong messages. The statement by China’s Defence Minister Li Shangfu was especially sharp. Referring to “navigational hegemony” being used on the pretext of “freedom of navigation”, he warned of a “whirlpool of conflict” if Western militaries did not stay out of Chinese waters and airspace.\nFor his part, the American defence chief Lloyd Austin assailed China for risky aerial actions over the South China Sea and warned of a US response to “threatening actions”, “bullying or coercion”. But he also called for resumption of military dialogue especially in view of the fact that Beijing turned down a bilateral meeting between Li and him in Singapore until the removal of sanctions imposed on the Chinese official for his role in the purchase of Russian weapons.\nAlthough this exchange of words only reinforced tensions. the unannounced visit to Beijing last month by the CIA chief Bill Burns marked an effort to bring down the temperature and mend ties. Explaining the nature of the trip, a US official was quoted as saying it aimed at emphasising to his Chinese counterparts “the importance of maintaining open lines of communications in intelligence channels”. He was the highest-level official of the Biden administration to visit China. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is now expected to go to Beijing in the coming weeks. His visit in February was called off amid rising tensions.\nWashington’s desire to halt the slide in ties was also evidenced in the statement by President Joe Biden at the Group of Seven (G7) summit last month that heexpectedan imminent thaw in relations with China. The summit’s May communique also laid out the US-led economic strategy for ‘de-risking’, rather than ‘de-coupling’ from the Chinese economy. The term is owed to Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, who used it a few months ago. She had said that “it is neither viable — nor in Europe’s interest — to decouple from China. Our relations are not black or white — and our response cannot be either. This is why we need to focus on de-risk — not decouple”.\nExpectations that relations between the US and China would stabilise have yet to materialise.\nThe notion is generally understood to mean business can continue with China so long as dependence is reduced on the Chinese economy, and it involves curbs on technology exports as well as diminishes China’s control of global supply chains. In one sense, it is acknowledgement that decoupling is an unrealistic goal. It may also be recognition of the reluctance by America’s European allies, whose largest trading partner is China, to be pushed too far in constraining their economic ties with Beijing without harming themselves. But as several others have also pointed out, the notion is imprecise and would be open to differing interpretations by America’s alliance partners especially in implementation. The Chinese, however, criticised the G7 statement and were unmoved by the seemingly new strategy. Their response has been dismissive, saying the change in nomenclature was meaningless as actions still targeted China and aimed at its containment.\nAlthough Biden and President Xi Jinping had agreed in theirfirst in-person meeting last November in Bali, on the sidelines of the G20 summit, to decelerate tensions and manage their competition “responsibly”, that has been easier said than done. Differences have not narrowed over the contentious issues and disputes that divide them — Taiwan, trade, technology curbs and military postures. Indeed, both sides then and later have been spelling out their respective red lines on Taiwan. Although the US has repeatedly reiterated its commitment to a One China policy, it has sounded warnings over what it sees as China’s coercive posture on Taiwan. Biden has even said US forces would intervene to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. The US has also been cementing an anti-China coalition by its Indo-Pacific strategy and through Quad, AUKUS security partnership and the Five Eyes group. This has strengthened Beijing’s belief that the US under Biden insists on pursuing a strategy to contain China, which has prompted an assertive response from Beijing.\nWashington is also engaged in a battle to maintain supremacy in technology with an intense ‘chip war’ underway. It has imposed sweeping measures to bar American companies and allied countries from exporting chips and advanced chip equipment to China in order to cripple its semiconductor industry, that manufactures chips and circuits for modern electronics ranging from supercomputers and smartphones to automobiles. These restrictions have further worsened relations.\nWhere does this dangerous confrontation leave the world’s most important bilateral relationship? Assessments vary about its future trajectory. Some experts see intense competition and tensions as inescapable, while others warn that unmanaged competition can put the two global powers on a collision course with unpredictable consequences. Still others see the danger of an unintended descent into war through miscalculation. As Henry Kissinger put it in a recent interview withThe Economist, “both sides have convinced themselves that the other represents a strategic danger”. He rightly stressed that the fate of the world depends on whether the two powers can learn to coexist. But that in turn would depend on whether the US can persuade itself to be less insecure about China’s rise. And equally important, on how responsive an increasingly assertive China will be to core US concerns."}]}

The PDM coalition will then be obliged to relinquish power and be replaced by caretaker governm­ents that have to be in place to hold general elections. But the road to elections is still clou­ded in uncertainty. With ministers adopting a purposively vague stance, speculation is rife about whether elections will be held on time.\nSome of this has been fuelled by the yet-to-be-completed digital census, which news reports indicate might push the election date beyond October as this would entail delimitation of constituencies. There is also uncertainty about the fate of the economy which remains in the critical ward.\nAny effort to play with the election date beyond what is constitutionally stipulated would be disastrous for the country. Fixing the economy can hardly be used as an excuse considering the PDM government’s failure to address the ongoing economic crisis. Band-aid measures have only kicked the can down the road and done little to deal with the structural sources of the crisis.\nFailure to revive the IMF bailout programme has underscored the extent of government mismanagement. The prospect of elections urged a reform-averse government to avoid taking necessary remedial measures to meaningfully address the perilous state of public finances.\nThebudgetwas a missed opportunity, with political considerations taking precedence over sound economics. The IMF criticised the lack of measures both on the revenue and expenditure side. This seemed to rule out chances of any deal.\nUncertainties are not limited to the economy. They extend to the electoral field and involve the question of who would or would not be allowed to run and whether opposition leader Imran Khan will be disqualified in one of the legal cases against him.\nPTI’s fate is also unclear given allegations by senior ministers that theMay 9 violencewas authorised by the party and its high command. Thus, an election minus Khan and his party cannot be ruled out irrespective of what this might mean for the credibility of the electoral exercise.\nThelaunch of a new party, Istehkam-i-Pakistan, comprising mostly lightweight second-string deserters from PTI may well be designed to pave the way for such an outcome so that voters are offered a choice beyond the two traditional parties and the contest is made to look real. But would that really make for genuine competition? That would be for voters to decide. The latest Gallup-Pakistan survey found that only a quarter of Pakistanis expressed confidence in the fairness of the upcoming elections.\nThe economy remains in the critical ward while doubts persist if elections will be on time.\nVoter turnout would be a key indicator of how free and open the electorate is likely to see the process. While there are many unknowns along the path to elections, what can be said with some certitude is that a low turnout would leave a question mark on the winner’s mandate to govern. Turnout in previous elections has ranged between 51per cent (2018), 53pc (2013), 44pc (2008) and 41pc (2002). The lowest — in 2002 — reflected voters’ response to an election held under military rule and therefore not viewed as free or fair.\n\nIf turnout drops considerably below the above, those who secure public office by a minority vote resting on a low turnout will end up with weak representative credentials. This will cast the credibility of their victory in some doubt and undermine their legitimacy.\nSecuring a feeble mandate in an environment of public cynicism in which the majority of voters may choose not to cast the ballot will neither translate into real authority nor empower a fragile democracy.\nOf course, much would also depend on whether the two traditional parties are able to motivate and inspire the electorate by what they offer by way of programme or policy. Their present conduct suggests these parties and their leaderships remain obsessively preoccupied with discrediting Khan in what appears to be a strategy of overkill.\nBoth are also burdened by incumbency especially in light of the worst economic crisis the country has faced, with inflation fuelling widespread public discontent. Neither has outlined any vision for the future; nor how they would address the country’s many challenges. Their public messaging is muddled, negative and so far, directionless.\nHardly the stuff to excite voters, especially new voters. Twenty million have been added to the electoral rolls in the past five years, since 2018. That’s a significant 16pc of the electorate.\nApart from voter participation, another scenario to be considered is if a truncated PTI is allowed to contest minus Khan. In this case, the electoral battle that takes shape in Punjab could see the vote divide among four major contestants on National Assembly seats (PML-N, PTI, IPP and PPP) although the latter’s support in the province has long waned. This could make it hard for any party to secure an overall majority.\nA shaky coalition government with a weak mandate would then be unable or unwilling to take the bold and decisive actions needed to extricate the economy from crisis. The possibility of a political outcome inconsistent with the requirements to fix the economy should be a matter of great concern.\nThis is all the more so as the economy faces a slew of negative trends, none of which are likely to be reversed in the months ahead. Internal and external financial imbalances remain wide, foreign exchange reserves have dwindled to a precarious level, inflation is at a historic high, domestic and foreign debt have reached unsustainable levels, the rupee has lost record value against the dollar, growth has stagnated, exports are falling, overseas remittances declining and foreign direct investment has plunged to a new low.\nPakistan is caught in a classic external debt trap. It faces external debt payments of around $23 billion in the fiscal year starting July, with reserves of only $4bn at present. The only way out for the country from having to borrow more and more to meet rising debt obligations is to secure debt relief. But that will not happen unless there is a strong reformist government committed to undertaking structural measures as part of a long-term policy plan. Can such a government emerge from the election?"}]}

Any initiative to address the dire economic situation is to be welcomed. But serious measures have to be rooted in reality and not reflect wishful thinking.\nA policy aim that sidesteps the country’s macroeconomic crisis and deteriorating state of public finances can only be construed as a flight from reality. Patchwork measures taken in isolation of the overall economic environment won’t work.\nThe roots of Pakistan’s economic crisis lie in chronic fiscal deficits, responsible for its perpetual balance-of-payments problems, high inflation and macroeconomic instability.\nWhat is needed, therefore, is a comprehensive plan to address structural issues and chart a path to sustainable growth that can end the vicious cycle of high budget/ balance-of-payments deficits, rising debt and chronic foreign exchange crises, which have led to repeated IMF bailouts.\nUnless structural issues are tackled, the country will not escape from the trap of anaemic growth, low savings and investment, high deficits, heavy borrowing, growing indebtedness and soaring inflation.\nInvestment levels only increase in an environment of economic and political certainty and stability, which can build confidence. Uncertainty undermines investment prospects and keeps investors hesitant.\nIt is a predictable and liberal business regulatory framework and commitments of policy continuity by governments that can foster a positive investment climate.\nNo one invests long-term capital if the rules of the game are frequently changed. Moreover, a level playing field for investors is necessary to attract significant investment — something the recent policy announcement fails to do, and therefore marks a step backwards in investment facilitation.\nThe fundamental factors that will determine Pakistan’s chances of achieving sustainable economic recovery are political as well as economic. The most important prerequisite isn’t, in fact, economic.\n\nIt is the quality of the country’s leadership and whether it leads a competent government that sees the significance of structural reform and has the motivation and credibility to take measures, painful in the near term, but which yield enduring dividends in the long run.\nPakistan’s economic crises have all been rooted in governance crises, with reform-averse ruling elites almost always seeking pain-free ways to deal with deep-seated economic problems.\nLack of leadership and absence of commitment to reform still stand in the way of economic revival.\nPakistan isn’t unique in facing a severe economic crisis. Many countries across the world — in Southeast Asia, Latin America and our neighbourhood — faced similar if not worse crises but were able to overcome imposing challenges to bounce back stronger and more resilient.\nIn each case, crises were turned into opportunities. Wrenching structural adjustments, tight fiscal policy and other reform measures were launched by leaderships who were convinced that long-term commitment and consistent policy implementation were essential to move ahead.\nLeadership is key. But so is an able and knowledgeable team of professionals who can assist the government in formulating and implementing reforms to deal with crises and ensure the country’s transition to sustained economic revival and growth. It is generally agreed that in every successful case of a country that created a better economic future, the quality of professionals who shaped and oversaw the reform process was critical.\nAgain, leadership matters. Leaders select the right team and then inspire it to stay the course and deliver. Institutional strength is also important. That determines how effectively policy measures and reforms are implemented. The secular decline in the quality and capacity of Pakistan’s civil service and its continuing generalist nature are now among the key impediments to policy implementation.\nAn important study commissioned by the World Bank, the Growth Report, examined the experience of countries around the world to draw lessons on what worked to make them economically successful. The report was put together by the Commission on Growth and Development set up by the World Bank, which comprised distinguished members, mostly from the Global South.\n\nThough published in 2008 its conclusions remain just as valid today. Most instructive is the identification of characteristics shared by countries that executed successful growth strategies. They ensured macroeconomic stability, maintained high rates of saving and investment, allowed markets to allocate resources and fully exploited the world economy.\nMost important, they all had credible and capable governments. Above all, the report points to the understanding by policymakers that “successful development entails a decades-long commitment and a fundamental bargain between the present and the future”.\nIn striking such a bargain, both the urgent and important have to be addressed. The urgent is, of course, the immediate financial crisis and the need for comprehensive measures to address that on a durable basis. But the bargain with the future also involves dealing with issues that are just as consequential to economic progress and the country’s future.\nThe most important of these is the coverage and quality of education that is on offer. Economic progress cannot be achieved without a solid educational base. An educated and skilled workforce is what makes the difference between the success or failure of economic development. This requires long-term policy decisions.\nYet successive federal governments have washed their hands off education using the pretext of the 18th Constitutional Amendment, which devolved education (other than higher education) to the provinces. Provincial governments for their part accorded it little priority.\nDecades of neglect and chronic underspending on education have left Pakistan with 22.8 million children out of school. It has earned the country the dubious distinction of having the world’s second highest number of out-of-school children. This has serious ramifications in view of Pakistan’s demographic profile and youth bulge.\nIt’s growing youthful population means that unless the scale and quality of education is expanded young people with no education or skills will face a jobless and hopeless future and a life of poverty.\nWhat Pakistan must do to secure a better economic future is more than evident — and always has been. But the poverty of leadership and lack of commitment to reform by the country’s political elites have stood in the way of meaningful progress. And it still does."}]}

The visit seemed to go well and included a meeting between Blinken and President Xi Jinping.\nBut, as has become a pattern in this complex relationship, any step forward is almost always followed by two steps backwards. And so it was this time. President Jo Biden’sdescription of Xi as a “dictator”at a fundraiser prompted a strong response from Beijing, which called the remarks irresponsible and a provocation. This again revived the friction between them.\nThen the red carpetrolled outby the Biden administration for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington and the thrust of their joint statement reflected the apparent US effort to cement India more firmly in an anti-China coalition and use it as a counterweight to Beijing.\nQuestions are again being raised about the future trajectory of the world’s most consequential relationship. There is now a rich body of literature that deals with the US-China confrontation and examines how this is likely to play out. Recent books include The Avoidable War by Kevin Rudd, The Long Game by Rush Doshi, Avoiding the ‘Thucydides Trap’ edited by Dong Wang and Travis Tanner, How China Loses by Luke Patey, Kishore Mahbubani’s Has China Won? and Oliver Letwin’s China vs America: A Warning.\nViews, of course, diverge especially over who will prevail in the contest. As do assessments of whether their intense competition presages a new cold war and if their fraught relations can drift into conflict, even if neither side may want it. That miscalculation, especially over the heavily militarised area around Taiwan, can lead to such an outcome is a worry for many countries in Asia and beyond. But even if conflict is avoided, their turbulent relationship will keep the global economy and the world in an unstable state.\nAn intelligent new book now joins the debate about the world’s most critical bilateral relationship although its canvas also extends to Russia. Cold Peace: Avoiding a New Cold War by Michael Doyle, a Columbia University professor, offers a comprehensive review of the many issues that lie behind East-West tensions. The author sets out to examine whether a new cold war is likely and how different it might be from the Cold War of the past.\n\nHe points to the dangers of a looming cold war but argues that this is not inevitable. Instead, a ‘cold peace’ can be established if certain key compromises are made by competing powers, which can yield cooperation in critical areas.\nHow the US-China relationship plays out has far-reaching repercussions for the world.\nThe distinction Doyle draws between the contours and character of the old and new cold war is insightful. He writes that like the original Cold War, the emerging cold war is a deeply structured conflict, both internationally and transnationally. There are similarities. Both are “non-armed conflicts” involving rivalries that go beyond contests for influence, power and prosperity. But he suggests that while Cold War I was fought primarily through proxy wars, arms races and espionage, the current confrontation entails a combination of cyber espionage, technological and industrial competition, political interference and arms contests.\nHe shows convincingly that the emerging Cold War II is not as extensive, extreme and polarising as its predecessor. Its reach is not yet global and “the sides are less clear-cut”, with alliances not so firmly formed or ideologically defined. But the weaponisation of cyber technologies is making the confrontation a deadly one.\nDoyle offers three reasons why the burgeoning cold war, dangerous as it is, will not be a replay of the original one. One, the likely costs of an escalating cold war between the US and China. Two, the large global common interest in interdependent prosperity and saving the planet from environmental degradation. And three, he sees China and Russia as authoritarian but not totalitarian.\nThe book’s main concern is how to prevent a second cold war. Doyle identifies what he sees as four bridges towards this end. The first concerns US-China cooperation on the shared challenge of climate change mitigation. The second is finding a negotiated end to the Ukraine conflict with Russia.\nHe sets forth a package of proposals on this, some workable, some unrealistic. The third bridge is détente between the US and China. Here too ideas for acompromise on Taiwanare presented. The fourth bridge to a ‘cold peace’ is to forge new rules on cyber. While acknowledging clashing interests and ambitions, he argues that compromises are possible to limit the harmful fallout of cyber hacking and warfare.\n\nFor Doyle, diplomatic accommodation to achieve a cold peace would also involve a “non-subversion pact”, resting on mutual commitments not to attack the political independence and territorial integrity of each other. That also means barring covert operations. The book has interesting ‘solutions’ to many of the vexed issues pushing the world towards more turbulence and instability. But as others have also observed, it overemphasises the role of domestic factors and ideology as drivers of a new cold war.\nDoyle clearly comes down on the side of greater engagement between the US and China, agreeing with other authors and experts about the danger of collision between them. Rudd made the case for “managed strategic cooperation”, Mahbubani for the two powers to seek areas of convergence based on their core interests, while Letwin called for “peaceful competition”.\nOne of the most influential books on this subject, published in 2017, was Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap? by Harvard scholar Graham Allison.\nIn this, he invoked the ancient Greek historian Thucydides’s depiction of the deadly trap that emerges when one great power challenges or is poised to displace another. Thucydides had emphasised the inevitability of war when fear of the rise of a new power determined the established power’s actions.\nAllison’s advice to avoid Thucydides’s Trap resonates in Doyle’s book and in Henry Kissinger’s warning that any drift into conflict would have catastrophic consequences. Kissinger doesn’t exaggerate when he says that the fate of the world depends on whether the US and China can get along."}]}

The short-term arrangement will momentarily restore some confidence. But a fundamental change in policy direction is needed if the country is to address its economic crisis on a sustainable basis and establish durable economic stability. Financing requirements to meet external debt obligations are an estimated $25 billion this fiscal year. This necessitates mobilising additional funds. It means Pakistan will have to negotiate a longer-term funding deal with the IMF down the road.\nIn any case, an IMF programme is necessary but not sufficient for the country to achieve economic recovery and embark on a path of growth. A comprehensive set of home-grown structural reforms are needed for Pakistan to escape from the vicious cycle of high budget and balance-of-payments deficits, slow growth, low savings and investment, excessive borrowing, rising indebtedness and soaring inflation. The cost-of-living crisis fuelled by the unprecedented level of inflation has placed an onerous burden on people. The public’s greatest expectation from their government is that it competently manages the economy to alleviate their plight and provide them with a better economic future.\n\nWith the election season around the corner, what are political parties doing to show people they have a serious plan to deal with the country’s economic challenges? So far, very little, if anything. Indeed, if news accounts are correct about arecent meeting of ruling coalition leaders in Dubai, their focus seemed to be more on who should be in the caretaker government and subsequent power-sharing arrangements between them than the economic problems facing the country. This suggests that the PDM parties still see governance as leveraging the spoils system rather than formulating public policy.\nThe real test, however, will come once elections are announced, because parties will then have to stake out their positions on economic as well as other issues. Voters will be able to determine whether in fact any party or leader has offered anything like an economic vision and has a strategy to extricate Pakistan from the economic mess it is in. But that doesn’t mean voicing the usual platitudes and clichés that figure so frequently in pronouncements by political leaders. There has been some talk about an ‘economic compact’ among parties, but this amounts to little more than a slogan as no one has cared to spell out what that should entail.\nOnly a fundamental break from the past can ensure a better economic future for Pakistan.\nSome would argue that elections in the past have hardly been fought on policy issues and, instead, have been about personalities, traditional loyalties and local, constituency factors. This, of course, is true. But that view overlooks the fact that the ongoing economic crisis has affected people like never before and therefore public expectations may be very different from the past in the intensely fraught economic environment today. Not surprisingly, in successive public opinion surveys, people identify the economy as their number one concern. In a survey conducted by Ipsos in March, inflation and unemployment were the top public concerns. It would follow from this that many voters will look more closely at which political party can better handle the country’s economic troubles and ease their hardship. Voters are also likely to punish incumbents for their worsening economic plight.\nApart from what political parties may have to offer on economic policy, there is also the question of whether the nature of the election outcome will help or hinder efforts at serious economic reform. Present indications are that Pakistan’s era of coalition governments is not about to end. The pattern is likely to persist of a hung parliament with no party able to win an overall majority and form a government on its own. If the past is any guide, a coalition government will find it harder to secure consensus or agreement on tough economic measures, especially as the likely parties in such an arrangement (the two major parties in the present ruling coalition), are status quo parties in the first place, which have demonstrated little commitment to reform. Thus, coalition politics might inhibit the ability of the next government to take decisive actions and launch bold reforms. There are examples of coalition governments elsewhere in the developing world that managed to carry out far-reaching reforms, but it needed strong commitment by key parties to such action — a crucial element missing in our case, as none of the parties can be deemed as reformist.\nThere is also the strong likelihood of elections producing a regionalised outcome, with different parties forming governments in the four provinces. This reflects the reality of the country being bereft of a truly national party with roots and support in all provinces. Regionalised results in recent general elections also indicate the growing fragmentation of politics. As this trend is also likely to continue, it will magnify the challenge for the federal government to manage such a polity and, more importantly, build inter-provincial consensus on major issues of economic policy and reform.\nOf course, before the country goes to the polls, there will be a period of some months when a caretaker government will be in charge. Its main task will be to supervise and preside over the election. But at a time when an ailing economy will need to be carefully managed and delicately handled, leadership on this count will be expected from the interim government. By prior agreement with the major parties, it can also take steps to strengthen and reinforce stabilisation measures to sustain the momentum of economic recovery.\nThere are many unknowns going forward. What is not in doubt is that the government that will emerge from elections, whatever its complexion, will have the responsibility to take the process of economic revival forward. Whether it can live up to that responsibility is an open question. But nothing less than a fundamental break from the past can ensure a better economic future for the country and its citizens."}]}

This at a time when the world is in the midst of an intensely unsettled period.\nMounting geopolitical tensions and economic volatility are contributing to global instability. The most significant strategic dynamic is theconfrontation between the US and China, which has far-reaching consequences for the world. Meanwhile, power shifts continue in an increasingly fragmented international system, with multilateralism under growing stress.\nAt the same time, geopolitical shifts in the Middle East are realigning relations among regional states and transforming the strategic landscape there.\nGiven this changing international environment the next government would be well advised to undertake a broad review of the country’s foreign policy. It is unclear when such a wide-ranging review was last undertaken. Certainly, there hasn’t been one for over a decade — a period that has seen fundamental regional and global changes.\nA review doesn’t mean a change in foreign policy objectives. It means adjusting policy to changes and reshaping the country’s strategy to more effectively pursue goals.\nA review also enables consideration of key relationships in a wider context and not in silos, which has obvious drawbacks. This will also afford an opportunity to evolve a strategy that matches the country’s goals to its diplomatic resources and international capital. Aligning ends with means is after all the most fundamental prerequisite for a viable strategy. The foreign ministry has long needed more investment.\nIn recent years, Pakistan’s foreign policy has been a series of ad hoc responses to regional and global developments rather than part of a well- considered, coherent approach. It has been reactive and lacking in initiatives.\n\nA review will help to inject clarity in policy and encourage a proactive approach. It will offer a chance to Pakistan’s diplomatic missions to make policy inputs. Usually, inputs are intermittently sought on single issues, not a wider canvas. It could generate new thinking to strengthen the country’s diplomatic efforts, which need to be more imaginative and go beyond worn-out talking points.\nImportantly, as some critical foreign policy areas are being dealt with by the military, a review should help to initiate a substantive conversation on these issues between civilian and military officials. This could promote better coordination and perhaps enable the foreign ministry to persuade the army leadership to see it as the country’s first line of defence and competent to handle issues on which they have sometimes had little say in recent years.\nA broad review will help adapt strategy to regional and global geopolitical changes.\nA major foreign policy concern for Pakistan will be to navigate the US-China confrontation and avoid getting into the crosshairs of big power rivalry.\n\nRelations with China will remain Pakistan’s overriding priority, as this offers the best hope for the realisation of its security and economic objectives. But relations need consistent reinforcement to keep them on a positive trajectory and close collaboration to ensure the China Pakistan Economic Corridor is fully developed in line with mutual interests.\nAs the pivot of China’s Belt and Road Initiative — the 21st century’s most ambitious geoeconomic project — CPEC’s timely progress is critical to reinforce Beijing’s interest in strengthening Pakistan, economically and strategically.\nTies with the US continue to be among Pakistan’s most critical bilateral relationships. But relations have been at an inflection point since the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan. For almost two decades, Afghanistan was the principal basis for relations, which were largely shorn of bilateral content and marked by both cooperation and mistrust.\nNow that this context has changed the relationship needs to be redefined and this at a time when the overwhelming US strategic priority is containment of China.\nThe challenge for the two countries is to find space between the Pakistan-China strategic relationship and the growing US-India partnership to identify areas of cooperation on which to reset and rebuild ties. Pakistan also needs to raise its diplomatic game in Washington, especially on Capitol Hill where its presence remains weak.\nStable ties with Afghanistan are Pakistan’s strategic compulsion. But despite the upsurge in trade between the neighbours, the relationship has been under considerable stress. Islamabad’s expectation that the return of a Taliban government would help Pakistan secure its western border has not been met.\nInstead, concerns have grown over continuingcross-border attacksand the fact that the outlawed militant organisation, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, is still based in Afghanistan. Several rounds of security talks with Afghan Taliban leaders have not produced any significant outcome. The next government should therefore revisit our Afghan policy and evolve an approach, between appeasement and confrontation, that ensures Kabul responds to Pakistan’s security concerns.\n\nManaging relations with Delhi will undoubtedly be the most vexing foreign policy issue, with India continuing to pose an external challenge to the country’s security. Relations plunged to a new low after Indian illegally annexed Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019, bifurcated and absorbed it into the Indian union.\nFormal dialogue and trade remain suspended with periodic flare-up of tensions. The diplomatic impasse continues with new irritants, including disagreement over the Indus Waters Treaty dispute settlement mechanism, adding to long-standing disputes.\nAs normalisation of ties is a remote possibility, Islamabad should consider how to put in place an agreed framework to manage tensions and prevent them from spinning out of control. The only bright spot in this otherwise bleak landscape is that the ceasefire on the Line of Control has largely held since the February 2021 re-commitment to it by both sides.\nRegional reconciliation in the Middle East involving rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran offers Islamabad new diplomatic opportunities. The next government should carefully examine how to leverage these to promote Pakistan’s political, economic and commercial goals.\nThe landmark development also opens space to improve relations and build greater trust with Iran, with whom ties have sometimes been frosty, even testy in the past.\nThis is not an exhaustive list of foreign policy issues for the next government. The EU, Pakistan’s second largest trading partner, UK, other Arab states, Southeast Asian nations and Africa all merit attention. In an increasingly multipolar world, Pakistan needs an outreach strategy to engage many more countries and actors beyond governments to accomplish its foreign policy objectives."}]}

This was the latest indication of growing strains in relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nTwo consecutive statements by the military last week voiced serious concerns about “the safe havens and liberty of action available to the TTP in Afghanistan”.\nThe first came after thevisit to Quetta by army chiefGen Asim Munir, which called on the Afghan interim government to abide by the commitments made in the Doha agreement (forged between the US and Taliban in 2020). A remark attributed to him warned of an “effective response” by the country’s security forces if attacks continued.\nThe second statement was issued after a corps commanders conference last Monday which said “the sanctuaries … available to terrorists of proscribed TTP … and availability of latest weapons to terrorists were noted [by the conference] as major reasons impacting [the] security of Pakistan”.\nDefence MinisterKhawaja Asif’s remarkswere just as tough. He accused Kabul of failing to abide by its commitments and said “Afghanistan is neither fulfilling its obligations as a neighbouring country nor safeguarding the Doha agreement”. He said “terrorists who shed the blood of Pakistanis find refuge on Afghan soil”, and warned that “Pakistan would employ all possible resources and measures” in response.\nThis round of statements was prompted by the terroristattack on an army garrisonin Balochistan’s Zhob town on July 12, which claimed the lives of nine soldiers. The same day an attack in Sui led to three more military casualties.\n\nThey were only the latest acts of violence in the area of the province close to the border with Afghanistan, where the TTP has expanded its activities from its main theatre in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In enlarging its operations to the Pakhtun part of Balochistan the outlawed group has increased the security threat to a province already dealing with violence by Baloch militants.\nThe country should consider policy options that elicit a response to its security concerns from the Taliban.\nIn fact, there has been a marked escalation in terrorist attacks targeting Pakistan’s security forces since the Taliban took over Afghanistan. A Pakistani defence ministry report leaked to the media in May stated that with Kabul unwilling to act against TTP, its regrouping in Afghanistan after the Taliban’s assumption of power posed a growing threat to Pakistan’s security.\nSuccessive reports by the UN Security Council’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team concluded that “TTP has arguably benefited the most of all the foreign extremist groups in Afghanistan from the Taliban takeover”.\nAttacks by TTP surged and became even more brazen after the collapse of its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The short-lived ceasefire was itself a futile attempt by the Pakistani authorities to end the armed group’s 14-year war on Pakistan. A wave of violence followed.\nIn one of the worst incidents of terrorism, the TTPattacked a mosquein Peshawar’s police lines in December which claimed over 100 lives and shook the country. Then too dire warnings were issued by Pakistani officials to the Taliban authorities. But to little avail.\nSeveral rounds of talks with Taliban officials also produced no outcome. In these talks Taliban leaders acknowledged the presence of TTP in their country (which they do not do publicly), offered assurances about restraining them but asked for time to accomplish this. They also argued that containing TTP was a question of their capacity and not commitment. But Islamabad’s patience has been running out.\nA high-level Pakistani delegation wasdispatched to Kabulin February with a one-point agenda: to make Taliban leaders understand Pakistan’s red line on terror attacks from Afghan soil and secure a firm commitment from Kabul to rein in TTP and deny it the sanctuary its fighters enjoy there. In these parleys, Taliban leaders asked for financial assistance, ostensibly to disarm and resettle TTP fighters and their families, estimated to be around 5,000, away from the border with Pakistan. But all this amounted to nothing.\nThis leaves Pakistan with a predicament on an issue with serious ramifications for the country’s security. What are its options? Issue public warnings and hope that this would pressure the Taliban to respond? That hasn’t worked so far and cannot yield an outcome different from the past.\nNo strategy can rest on hope. Do what Afghan Taliban leaders frequently urge and engage the TTP in talks again? That was a disaster the last time around and backfired badly on the country, whose consequences it is now having to deal with. Talks broke down when it became evident that TTP’s demands were non-negotiable.\nThey included withdrawal of Pakistan’s military forces from the border region, reversal of Fata’s merger with KP and imposition of Sharia in certain KP areas. Pakistan’s military authorities have rightly ruled out talks in acknowledgement of the past blunder.\nShould Pakistan consider strikes against terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan if the Taliban fail to act against TTP? Undeclared kinetic actions have already been undertaken by Pakistan, targeting TTP and eliminating some senior leaders. But this is not a tenable approach and has obvious risks and drawbacks.\nThere are other disincentives (and incentives) in the country’s policy toolkit that should be carefully considered with the aim to both persuade Taliban leaders and raise the cost of non-cooperation for them. Islamabad also needs to work on a regional option. It should evolve a coordinated regional strategy so that collective pressure is brought to bear on Kabul.\nSecurity after all is a concern for all of Afghanistan’s neighbours even if their other interests vary. The greatest convergence is between Pakistan and China which underlines the importance of the trilateral Pakistan-China-Afghanistan forum to raise and resolve security concerns relating to terrorist groups based in Afghanistan. What is clear is that Pakistan’s present Afghan policy needs to be revisited and recast to more effectively protect its security interests."}]}

Multilateralism is facing growing challenges in an increasingly fragmented international system. The resurgence of East-West tensions, Ukraine war and intensifying US-China confrontation have further shrunk the space for multilateral cooperation. Multilateralism though has been in retreat for well over a decade now.\nStrong headwinds unleashed by competing crises are making the future outlook a troubled one.\nClimate change has emerged as among the present era’s greatest risks. Yet a deeply divided world is increasingly falling short of addressing multiple, interconnected challenges that are consequential for all countries.\nIt is clearly time for the international community to take stock and consider how to forge agreement on a global framework to address common challenges. A major initiative to do that is planned at the UN Summit of the Future called by Secretary General (SG) António Guterres and endorsed by all member states of the world body.\nCan agreement be forged on a global framework to address common challenges?\nThis summit, scheduled for September 2024, will seek to evolve a consensus on what a shared future should be and identify the means to achieve it. Guterres has described the summit as a “once in a generation opportunity” to strengthen multilateralism, renew the commitment to core principles and adopt an action-oriented ‘Pact for the Future’, which will set out concrete responses to global challenges. This is expected to emerge from intergovernmental negotiations ahead of the summit.\nAs part of the preparatory process for these deliberations, Guterres has issued nine policy briefs on key issues which will be discussed by UN member states. A New Agenda for Peace, the policy paper unveiled earlier this month, focuses on issues of peace and security. This offers twelve specific proposals in five priority areas. In his introduction to the report and op-eds he recently authored, the SG states that with the post-Cold War period over, the world is moving towards a new global order with multipolarity as a defining feature. Never before have countries had to confront so many cross-boundary sources of instability and insecurity. Peace remains elusive as conflicts continue across the world while geostrategic competition is engendering geoeconomic fragmentation.\nAccording to Guterres, all of this makes international cooperation an imperative in order to avoid more human suffering. This is especially so when disquiet is growing among people across the world that governments and international organisations are failing to deliver for them. He calls for a “new multilateralism” which goes beyond the narrow security concerns of countries, and is based on the principles of trust, universality and solidarity. It should also promote sustainable development and respect for human rights.\nThis ambitious policy brief prioritises five key areas. The first is to encourage “prevention” at the global level by tackling geopolitical divisions and strategic risk. The recommendation is to make greater use of preventive diplomacy.\nNoting the continuing threat of nuclear war, it proposes a ban on the use of nuclear weapons and calls for their eventual elimination. An omission here is absence of a recommendation to proscribe the resort to force, especially as conflicts raging across the world involve the use of conventional force. The brief itself notes the surge in armed conflicts in the past decade, which reversed a 20-year decline, with the number of conflictrelated deaths reaching a 28-year high in 2022.\nThe second priority area identified is a “paradigm for prevention” within countries to deal with “all forms of violence”, so as to promote social cohesion, create links between sustainable development, climate action and peace, ensure meaningful participation of women and fully respect all dimensions of human rights. This is an ambitious goal given the uneven record among developing countries on this account.\nThe third area in the report concerns UN peacekeeping. It proposes updating peacekeeping operations to adjust to changing conflict environments, especially challenges posed by unresolved conflicts where there is no peace to keep.\nThe actions proposed include avoiding unrealistic mandates for peacekeeping missions, having more integrated operations and recommitting to reform in this area — all welcome and implementable suggestions. They are directly relevant for Pakistan, which has been among the world’s top troop contributing countries to UN peacekeeping missions for over six decades. Since 1960, over 200,000 Pakistani service men and women have served in 46 UN missions in 26 countries around the world. Currently, over 4,300 service personnel are deployed in 10 missions.\nThe fourth priority focuses on prevention of the weaponisation of emerging domains and technologies and promoting “responsible innovation”. This calls for measures to address threats posed by new technologies, including artificial intelligence, and urges a prohibition on lethal autonomous weapons systems. There can be no disagreement with the contention that “machines with the power and discretion to take lives without human involvement are morally repugnant and politically unacceptable and should be prohibited by international law”.\nThe last priority action area recommends building a stronger collective security machinery, including reform of the Security Council, General Assembly and the UN’s disarmament agency. The document calls for expediting negotiations for Council reform to make it more “just and representative” and democratise its working methods.\nOn the latter, there is firm consensus among states.\nBut fundamental differences persist on how to reform the Security Council especially between countries that aspire to permanent membership and others, including Pakistan, opposed to enlarging and reinforcing centres of privilege and who argue the only way to make the Council more representative, democratic and accountable is to add more elected, non-permanent members. This has held up progress in negotiations. Unless these differences are resolved, reform will remain elusive.\nHaving circulated this and other policy briefs to UN member countries, it will now be up to them to deliberate over these and offer their own proposals to arrive at a consensus for a ‘Pact for the Future’. As Guterres points out in his conclusion to the brief, it is member states who have primary responsibility to carry out reform. The big question is whether at a time when the world is so fractured and divided, meaningful and substantive agreement can be forged on the future framework for multilateral cooperation."}]}

The rapprochement left the US diplomatically marginalised in the Middle East and undermined several of its regional goals, most notably isolating Iran and normalising relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. By playing a mediatory role, China established itself as a major player and power broker in the Middle East, much to Washington’s discomfort. The US barely concealed its unease with this potentially game-changing development, which has already realigned relations among regional states and begun to transform the strategic landscape there.\nNow the Biden administration is trying to get back in the game in the Middle East and contain growing Chinese influence there. President Joe Bidenacknowledgedthat efforts are in progress for a deal with Riyadh aimed at establishing ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel. On July 28, he told donors at a fundraiser for his 2024 re-election bid, that “a rapprochement may be underway”. He did not reveal more. However, details about his new ‘plan’ were disclosed a day earlier in aNew York Timesop-ed by Thomas Friedman, who had interviewed the president the previous week. According to him, the Biden administration was considering a “big Middle East deal”. This would involve Saudi Arabia normalising relations with Israel in return for a mutual security pact with the US, and Riyadh committing to provide a generous aid package to the Palestinians in the West Bank and scale back ties with China. Israel, for its part, would promise not to seize the West Bank, cease expansion of settlements there and re-commit to a two-state solution. The Palestinian Authority would have to reciprocate by supporting the Saudi-Israel peace deal.\nThe visit by a high-level US delegation to Saudi Arabia to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman indicated that American officials were seeking to explore such a deal. White House officials were quoted as saying talks on July 27 between Saudi leaders and US national security adviser Jake Sullivan as well as Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk, discussed the possibility of a normalisation agreement although official statements by both sides did not mention this.\nSeveral key questions are raised by what is being termed as Biden’s ‘grand bargain’ for the Middle East even though this is in an exploratory phase at present. Why is such a deal being considered now by the White House? What are its objectives? What are the chances of the deal being sealed? Would an agreement stick even if it is forged? First, the question of timing. Washington has long wanted to normalise Saudi-Israel relations especially afterseveral Arab states established ties with Israelunder the so-called Abraham Accords of 2020. Riyadh, reports suggest, drove a hard bargain and made several demands — a defence pact with the US, a civilian nuclear deal, missile defence system/other high-tech weapons and substantial Israeli concessions for the Palestinians. Clearly, the Saudi-Iran rapprochement disrupted whatever initial efforts were earlier in progress, while arguably enhancing Saudi Arabia’s bargaining power. But that development also gave urgency to US diplomatic efforts in order to restore its regional influence and leverage.\nThe US seeks to restore its position in the Middle East and contain China’s growing influence.\nTiming may have much to do with the onset of the presidential election season as electoral dynamics begin to take over later this year and the focus shifts to domestic politics. The fact that Biden first publicly spoke about the deal at a fundraiser suggests he may also have an eye on its political dividends at home, especially as he has little to show by way of any foreign policy success. Facing a serious challenge in the election, a vulnerable Biden candidacy may need all the help it can get. At the same time, the move comes rather late in the day as such a complicated deal will need lengthy and difficult negotiations. Moreover, as Biden’s re-election is uncertain this casts doubt on the survivability of a deal even if it is concluded.\nThe multiple aims of a potential deal are apparent: re-establish America’s dominance in the region, reverse China’s diplomatic and economic gains, and reorder regional relationships to serve US and Israeli interests. Providing some relief to the Palestinians in the West Bank will also help to burnish US credentials and image among Arab and other Muslim countries even if Israel gets a better bargain out of this.\nThe chances for diplomatic success are slim as the challenges are formidable in complicated US-Saudi-Israeli-Palestinian negotiations among four parties. This is especially so at a time when doubts persist in the region about American reliability. Recently, new military deployments in the Middle East announced by Washington represented an effort to restore its credibility by showing its seriousness about re-engagement. Whether the various parties have enough confidence in the US and its ability to implement the deal to make necessary concessions is open to question, not least because America is on the cusp of a presidential election. The Saudi and Israeli governments may want to wait it out to see the outcome of the US presidential race before committing to any deal. Both have had troubled relations with the Biden administration in recent years.\nSome foreign policy experts and former US officials see the ‘grand bargain’ idea as a “non-starter” or “far-fetched” while Friedman described it as “a long shot, at best”. The Saudis, Israelis as well as the Palestinians would have to make fundamental, politically tough concessions for negotiations to make headway. Whether the US still has sufficient leverage with all of them to secure these concessions is doubtful. Israel’s national security adviser has said the road to such a deal was “still too long” while the government’s far right ministers voiced opposition to any concessions to the Palestinians. Then there is the US Congress, where Republicans would hardly favour a defence pact with Riyadh, and Democrats seem unlikely to agree to a deal that does not guarantee a two-state solution and adequately protect Palestinian rights.\nAll this makes the chances of progress towards an agreement a remote possibility. But like politics, diplomacy is the art of the possible."}]}

It confronts multiple, interconnected challenges which have, over the decades, been feeding off and reinforcing each other in an unbroken cycle.\nThey include the structuralcrisisof the economy, erosion in the state’s institutional capacity, persisting education deficit, uncontrolled population growth, and climate change. Security challenges also persist with an unstable Afghanistan on the western frontier and a hostile India on the country’s eastern flank.\nThis is a moment for introspection as well as thinking about the future. Pakistan’s history shows that successive governments have spent a good deal of time fire-fighting in crisis management mode. The country has been so mired in one crisis after another that long-term planning has been elusive. So has thinking about durable ways to address the country’s challenges and ensure a brighter future for people.\nTrue that Pakistan has weathered many storms and crises in the past. Its resilience has never been in doubt. This enabled it to overcome its troubles of the time. But present-day systemic challenges are fundamentally different. They are the cumulative consequence of decades of misgovernance and squandered opportunities. These problems can no longer be kicked down the road. All need to be tackled simultaneously if Pakistan is to move forward and embark on a path of economic and political stability and prosperity for its people.\nThe choice today is stark. Either the country continues to be trapped in a quagmire of weak governance, politics-as-usual, economic stagnation, and eroding public faith in state institutions, or it can take advantage of the social and economic changes underway to chart a new course. The choice is between a dysfunctional governance system and one that works and responds to the needs and aspirations of all citizens, not just a narrow power elite.\nCan the old mould of politics be broken by socioeconomic changes underway?\nA key impediment in breaking from the past is that representational and electoral politics have remained frozen in an old mode and increasingly lagged behind the social and economic changes that have been altering the country’s political landscape.\nThe economic centre of gravity has been shifting to urban centres from the countryside, but politics — and most political parties — have yet to catch up with all its implications. Several developments in recent decades offer opportunities to realign politics and governance to public purpose and not remain hostage to the interests of an elite whose preoccupation is with ‘rulership’ rather than public service.\n\nThis does not mean entrenched structures of politics can be transformed overnight or that long-persisting fault lines will easily fade away. But prospects for a departure from politics-as-usual are better today. This is due to a number of trends or factors.\nThe first is the emergence of a larger middle class in the context of increasing urbanisation. The 2023 census shows greater urbanisation, with almost 40 per cent of the population now living in urban areas — a significant increase from the last census in 2017.\nThe increase in the urban population has been evidenced in all provinces across the country. Although there is little agreement among Pakistani scholars about the size (and definition) of the middle class, there is no dispute that it has been growing in recent decades.\nIt is now an influential economic and social group that wants a bigger voice in national affairs. While not a homogenous group, it includes educated, professional groups as well as middle-income employees in state and business enterprises.\nMembers of the urban middle class in general are becoming more politically assertive in voicing their expectations and demands for better governance and a political system that is responsive to their needs and aspirations. Of course, to be an agent for change, they would have to act in an organised way.\nThe shift in the economic centre of power is also creating new political dynamics. An important indicator of this is the declining share of agriculture in national output. This has fallen to around 22pc at present. Urban Pakistan now accounts for much of GDP.\nThese economic realities are intersecting with technology-driven changes and the information revolution to disperse political power. This, in turn, has the potential to transform the old political power structure of clansand traditionally influential families, whose stranglehold on politics has obstructed reform.\nThe third trend is a more ‘connected’ society empowered by modern information and communication technology. Access to technology is making people better informed and more aware of their rights. Most people now have access to more than one information channel and are more engaged with political affairs.\nThe exponential expansion of the broadcast media has offered a potent platform to the public to raise issues and influence opinion. So has social media, especially for younger citizens. Although the print and broadcast media has been subject to official control and restrictions, it has still managed to hold governments to account, subject executive action to oversight and suggest policy courses for national problems.\nAll this is gradually changing the relationship between state and citizen as well as how people evaluate governments and their performance.\nThe fourth trend is the growth of a more diverse and vibrant civil society. With space opening up for newer civil society organisations to emerge, these have come to reflect the interests and concerns of a more politically aware urban society and enabled members of the middle class to press their views and interests with greater vigour. This holds the possibility of changing the nature and content of political engagement.\nTogether, these factors can be a counterpoise to traditional ways of conducting politics. In fact, the confluence of greater urbanisation, a more ‘connected’ society empowered by modern communications, and emergence of a larger middle class all offer a transformational opportunity, opening space for the emergence of challenges to traditional, hereditary and personalised politics.\nThe question is whether the increasing mismatch or disconnect between socioeconomic changes and family or clan politics can unleash dynamics to break the old political and governance mould anchored in patronage and clientelist politics rather than public policy. But a different kind of leadership is needed to understand and leverage these changes to transform the way Pakistan governs itself."}]}

The months leading up to the polls will see political leaders and their parties engaged in fierce electoral competition to secure power. Winning public office will obviously be their goal. But the question is, what plan and policies will they offer voters about how they propose to address the country’s myriad challenges? What public purpose will leaders bring to governance if elected?\nNever before has Pakistan faced such a wide array of overlapping challenges, all of which need to be tackled with courage, imagination, and determination if they are to be surmounted. But politics in recent years has been focused more on power struggles than on public issues. Political leaders have directed much of their energy to power tussles and efforts to subdue opponents rather than evolving and presenting any policy plans.\n\nThis has made political parties almost indistinguishable in terms of their position on issues of public concern. The usual platitudes and clichés have dominated the political discourse, with no new policy ideas generated about how to deal with the country’s problems. At other times, vacuous rhetoric has substituted for policy proposals.\nThe most consequential challenge is, of course, the economy which remains precariously poised. Without sustainable economic recovery, the rest will be in vain. Thestand-by agreementwith the IMF has been projected as a major step towards economic stability. But it is only a temporary reprieve and, in any case, should be anchored in a comprehensive home-grown economic plan of structural reforms which can revive economic growth.\nOfficial sights have been set so low that averting a debt default has become the principal goal of economic policy, and is even celebrated as an achievement. Qualifying for a Fund programme is regarded as a great accomplishment even though it is a sign that the country is in dire and desperate economic straits.\nHaving a record 23 IMF programmes is a reflection of poor, not good economic management. Of course, financial bailouts are necessary to stay solvent but they cannot become the be-all and end-all of economic strategy. Hyper-borrowing both at home or abroad can hardly be touted as a gain for the country.\nTrue that the outgoing coalition government announced an “economic revival plan” predicated on the creation of theSpecial Investment Facilitation Councilto promote “fast track” investment by friendly GCC countries in ailing state-owned enterprises and “untapped sectors of the economy”.\nAnnouncements were made about the sale of public assets and state-owned businesses to Gulf states in a strategy to earn dollars by privatising state assets. But hopes of investment in new sectors cannot be delinked from the country’s ongoing macroeconomic crisis and unstable economic environment.\nMoreover, foreign investment — whether from Gulf countries or beyond — requires consistency and predictability of policy as well as an atmosphere of political certainty and stability. It also needs a level playing field, transparency, and reliability of judicial enforcement to give confidence to investors.\nWill political leaders offer new policy ideas about how to solve the country’s problems?\nAs for economic revival, a serious plan has to rest on wide-ranging structural reforms that address the root causes of Pakistan’s chronic external and internal financial imbalances — a narrow tax and export base, outsized state sector, insolvent power sector, and low savings rate.\nThe effectiveness of economic policy and reform in turn depends on the state of governance. The political context weighs heavily on the success or failure of economic policy. The best-conceived economic initiatives will go nowhere if there is weak or poor governance. After all, Pakistan’s persistent economic crises have all been rooted in a governance crisis.\nThe question this raises is whether the various aspirants for power in the electoral race have thought seriously about these and other issues that are pivotal for Pakistan’s economic and political future. Do they have policy proposals to offer to indicate their government will have an aim other than wielding power? Will the election only be about who secures public office or also about what they plan to do with that power to solve the country’s problems?\nThese problems include the eroding capacity of the institutions of governance. This imposes obvious limits on the exercise of power and ability to execute policies. It is also responsible for the long-term decline in public confidence in government institutions, as reflected in successive opinion surveys. The state’s institutional capacity has weakened over time, and consequently, the delivery of public services has deteriorated and fallen well short of people’s expectations.\nThis has happened because of two main reasons: one, postponed reforms, and two, politicisation of the civil service. Governance after independence required transforming colonial-era administrative structures to those in sync with the requirements of a developing country. But lack of reforms meant the administrative system was unable to keep pace with a changing society and the complex needs of modern governance.\nThe protracted politicisation of the bureaucratic and police system distorted its functioning and produced several deleterious consequences — the erosion of authority, the undermining of efficiency, the de-emphasis of merit, and the draining of morale.\nFor these reasons, the quality of the civil service has been in secular decline. Yet, achieving economic recovery and setting Pakistan on a path of growth and investment depends critically on strengthening institutional capacity that can efficiently mobilise resources, ensure proper service delivery and create a credible business-friendly environment.\n\nThis ought to make civil service reform an urgent priority. But again, it is unclear if any political party is committed to launching such reforms. Have political leaders done any thinking on how best to transform the apparatus of governance?\nOf course, the answers to these questions will come when the election campaign starts and gets into swing. Then voters will be able to judge if those in the race for power have any programme and policies to offer, which go beyond the usual tired and lazy slogans.\nPeople expect a departure from the past and want to see a government that isn’t just interested in wielding power but acts purposefully in the public interest."}]}

First, there is the usual round of condemnations. Then there is an expression of sympathy for the victims, photo-ops with them, and resolve to deal ‘firmly’ with those responsible for the atrocity.\nBut often words and tweets are all that are on offer rather than tangible actions to prevent the next tragedy. Soon, the incident is forgotten, and the government as well as the media move on. The underlying problem responsible for the tragedy is left to fester and flare up again.\nConsider thehorrendous attackon the churches and homes of the Christian community in Jaranwala by violent mobs. This was followed by strong words andcalls for “inter-faith harmony”by government leaders, anappearanceby the caretaker prime minister and Punjab chief minister in Jaranwala, and assurances to track down and punish the perpetrators of the rampage. Were any meaningful actions taken to signal that the state will not tolerate such behaviour, whatever its motivation? No. And not for the first time.\nAttacks on minorities have continued with impunity as the deterrent against such attacks simply isn’t in place. The guilty are rarely caught or prosecuted, much less punished. This is evidenced by the absence of convictions in most previous incidents of violence against minorities.\n\nMoreover, there is a lack of protection for minorities and their places of worship, or efforts to calm the situation when there is a clear and present danger to their safety. Beyond delivering homilies, governments do little to avert another attack. Successive governments have, in fact, responded so timidly to violence by religious extremists, that it has unintendedly encouraged rather than deterred them.\nThe reliance on words rather than actions is, of course, not limited to official reactions to tragedies and violent events. It is pervasive in every area of government functioning and has become a familiar practice among political leaders and other managers of state.\nSermons are delivered with tiresome frequency and exhortations are issued that urge people to do one thing or another. But the surfeit of rhetoric hardly obscures the lack of policy and administrative actions to deal with the issue at hand. Government leaders announce goals (‘we will end violence’, ‘we will promote harmony’, ‘the rule of law will be enforced’, and so on) as if they are magically self-enforcing. Showcasing intentions is deemed sufficient to show they are governing. Platitudes and trite statements serve as substitutes for policy measures.\nAll talk and no action denudes governments of credibility.\nNowhere is this more telling than in the area of economic governance. Here, government rhetoric has long clashed with grim reality. It is one thing to try to build confidence by offering a positive outlook. But if there is a yawning gap between official claims and on-ground reality, the effort boomerangs.\nAlso, goals are stated without identifying the means and strategy to achieve them — ‘we will increase exports’, ‘record tax resources will be mobilised’, ‘inflation will be controlled’. Clichés are stated as profound statements of policy.\nPronouncements aboutattracting foreign direct investmentare a case in point. New bodies are set up with hyper claims that overseas investors will flock to the country. Investors are expected to respond to official exhortations to take advantage of opportunities and rush forward.\nAgain, the disconnect with reality is telling. There has been a precipitous decline in FDI in recent years. Even the modest level of $2 billion in FY 2022 (0.4 per cent of GDP) declined by 25pc in FY 2023. It is now negligible as a consequence of the macroeconomic crisis and protracted political uncertainty.\nForeign investment flows to where the security situation is stable. Investor interest also depends on the quality of available infrastructure and reliability of power supplies as well as certainty about judicial enforcement of rules. An unstable macroeconomic environment is an obvious impediment. So is the absence of policy continuity and lack of consistency in rules among provinces.\nSignificant investment can hardly take place when policies lurch between liberal business measures and foreign exchange restrictions, profit repatriation curbs, and import controls. Words and exhortations do not change this reality.\nIn some instances, words are used in a self-delusionary way. Some ministers in the previous ruling coalition made extravagant claims in the last days of their government about ‘trillions of dollars worth of mineral deposits’ in the country waiting to be exploited. When investment in this sector hasn’t been forthcoming for decades and has still not materialised, it is misleading to make such hyperbolic statements, especially as there is a big difference between theoretical/technical potential and economic value.\nAnother disingenuousstatementwas made recently by a minister in the caretaker government, who declared he is “determined to take Pakistan’s ICT exports from $2.4bn to $10 to $20bn”. In a short-duration government?\nPerhaps the most glaring example of a ‘policy’ announcement made amid much fanfare but not grounded in reality was two years ago, when the then government proclaimed that Pakistan’s foreign policy focus wouldshiftto geoeconomics from geopolitics.\nApart from the fact that the two are interrelated and thus inseparable, the wordy document issued on this set forth a vision without identifying a strategy to achieve it. It also conveniently ignored the most fundamental requirement for a geo-economic strategy — a strong economy powered by growth and investment.\nA crisis-ridden economy perpetually on the brink can hardly become the basis of such policy. Serving as an element in another country’s global geoeconomic strategy doesn’t turn Pakistan into a geoeconomic player.\nIf Pakistan wants to pursue a geoeconomics policy in any meaningful sense, it has to transform its economy through structural reforms, ensure a stable political environment, and reorder its budget priorities.\nGeoeconomic power cannot be ‘borrowed’ or ‘imported’ from outside, but acquired by building a strong economic foundation with attractive and efficient markets and substantial trading capacity. Policy shifts are not accomplished by just talking and the use of buzzwords. Little wonder then that official reference to this policy shift has all but vanished now.\nAnnouncements long on rhetoric and short on action only leave governments with a crisis of credibility."}]}

Several developments have fuelled more uncertainty at a time when the country is already in a tense and unsettled state. This has created the prospect of greater instability ahead. The conflation of crises could even push the country towards a tipping point.\nNationwidestreet protestsby traders and members of the public over the sudden and excessive rise in electricity bills have confronted the government with a challenge. It is now struggling for a response that can quell theprotestsbut also not upend the stand-by agreement with the IMF, which provided the financial bailout the country needed to avert a debt default.\nWhile talks with Fund representatives are underway to find a way to provide ‘relief’ to consumers, protests continue across the country.\nThese protests come on the back of a cost-of-living crisis fuelled by record inflation — mostly the result of economic mismanagement by governments in the recent past. This has worsened people’s plight in a deteriorating economic environment and bred widespread public discontent.\nIt was always a question of not if but when this discontent would spill over into the streets. The spark was provided by the exorbitant hike in utility charges. These protests can snowball into wider social unrest if other issues of public grievance — there are many — kick in. Such a potentially explosive situation would be beyond the interim government’s capacity to control.\nWhen people see no hope of improvement in their economic condition, it is hard to douse the flames of their anger. What has contributed to public rage is the fact that they are being asked to bear the burden of governance failures — mismanagement of the power sector by successive governments, failure to deal with its inefficiencies, and lack of reform.\nAdded to this is a glaring inequity. Certain sectors are exempt from additional electricity taxes, while several categories of state officials receive preferential treatment by way of free electricity. There cannot be a more telling example of a policy that only privileges the elite while the public pays the price. With therise in petroleum pricesand more painful measures ahead, public discontent is likely to intensify, not dissipate.\n\nAlready, cities across the country have seen acomplete shutter-down strikeby retail establishments in response to a call by the traders’ association. Such strikes have obvious economic consequences.\nThe conflation of crises can push the country to a tipping point.\nMeanwhile, political pressure is growing for elections to be held in 90 days, as stipulated by the Constitution. Last month, the Election Commission of Pakistan ruled this out when itissued a scheduleindicating it needed four months for fresh delimitation of constituencies, which it said it would complete in mid-December. This followedapprovalof the new population census, secured by the PDM government from the Council of Common Interests in its final days in power. The ECP’s decision to delay general elections and not specify a date prompted speculation that the polls could be pushed to February and even beyond. Uncertainty was also fuelled byinstallationof a gratuitously large caretaker government that began to act as if it were anything but a short-duration arrangement.\nThe election delay predictablyprovoked an outcryfrom several political parties, as well as a spate of legal challenges. Imran Khan’s PTI and the PPP demanded elections within the 90-day time frame. The PPP was party to the unanimous CCI decision on the digital census. Its latest stance suggested it has doubts on whether elections will even be held after completion of the delimitation process. Its U-turn is also an effort to distance itself from its former coalition partner, PML-N.\n\nA cynical explanation is that PPP is mounting pressure in response to administrative actions taken against some of its sympathisers, hoping the establishment will remedy this. In any case, this has left PML-N isolated as the only major party that wants a delay in elections. This signals a lack of confidence in its electoral prospects, especially after Shehbaz Sharif’s lacklustre tenure.\nThe Supreme Court Bar Association hasfileda constitutional petition in the apex court that seeks suspension of the ECP decision to hold elections on the new census. It points to the ECP’s responsibility to convene elections within 90 days of the Assembly’s dissolution. The Bar Council of Pakistan has made a similar demand. PTI and Jamaat-i Islami alsofiled petitionsin the top court seeking general elections within 90 days as mandated by Article 224(2) of the Constitution.\nWhile a legal battle looms, it also puts pressure on the interim government to weigh in on this even though that decision is for its patrons to take. The government’sresponsethrough the law ministry to President Arif Alvi’sletter to ECPasking for an election date questioned his authority to do this. But it skirted around the issue of when the polls should be called. During a meeting with journalists, Prime Minister Anwar-ul-Haq Kakarsimply saidit was for ECP to decide the timing.\nFor its part, the Supreme Court dismissed ECP’s plea for review of the Punjab election order last week, and made it clear it will not accept any transgression from the Constitution. Its ruling reiterated that elections within 90 days was a constitutional requirement. The chief justice said the court will intervene if there is any violation. The court verdict has intensified pressure on ECP to announce a schedule for general elections. So far, ECP’s response has been toshorten the time framefor the delimitation process to end-November without issuing a new schedule.\nNot announcing an election date has become a source of growing political controversy and legal contention. Doubts persist that elections may not even be held by February/ March. This is deepening polarisation in the country and having a damaging fallout on the economy. More uncertainty will raise the cost to an economy that is already on life support.\nIt will continue to produce instability in the capital market, vitiate the investment climate, encourage capital flight and delay any significant economic policy decisions. Whether or not the authorities realise this, it puts Pakistan’s economic future at grave risk."}]}

Which countries are middle powers and why do they have rising clout in the present era? How do we define them and assess their influence on the international stage? Is soft power also a factor in their global standing?\nThe notion of middle powers has long been around. But it has acquired new relevance in the current geopolitical context whose defining features are increasing multipolarity and theUS-China competition. There is no consensus in the growing literature about how to define middle powers. However, there is general agreement that these countries are neither among the world’s superpowers nor are they small powers as they have the ability to influence geopolitics.\nThis is due to their economic strength, military muscle or other attributes, including demographic characteristics, regional weight, soft power, diplomatic conduct and activism. This gives them significant leverage in global affairs and ability to build multiple relationships.\nThey include countries from the developed world and Global South, such as Germany, Japan, Canada, Brazil, India, South Africa, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Indonesia. They are a heterogeneous group of countries with varying governance systems as well as political and strategic interests. Pakistan is in some respects a middle power but its economic weakness has significantly limited and diminished its global influence.\n\nThe global debate about the role of middle powers has intensified as a consequence of the US-China stand-off. This hasn’t mimicked the Cold War in terms of dividing the world into a ‘tight’ bipolarity. But, as several analysts have noted, it has, instead, offered opportunities and leeway to countries to increase their leverage by playing off that rivalry and pursuing an ‘independent’ path.\nMoreover, structural changes and dispersal of power in the international system — the very currency of power also having changed — has created an enabling environment for middle power activism and for them to wield influence. As Alec Russell recentlywrotein a thoughtfulFinancial Timesop-ed, “The age of the Western set menu is over. And the new menu, while heavily influenced by two lead chefs, is still being written” — a reference to middle powers who now seek a seat at the table.\nLast month’sBRICS summitin South Africa renewed focus on middle powers and their aspiration to reconfigure the global order and rewrite the rules of the game.Expansion of the groupby addition of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Argentina, UAE and Ethiopia, with China working for enlargement, underlined how these emerging economies were seeking a bigger role by using the bloc as a countervailing force to US-led Western groupings, such as G7.\n\nThey also advocate reform of the international financial system and Bretton Woods institutions. As widely acknowledged, this expansion has increased the weight of BRICS, which represents over a quarter of the global economy and accounts for a major share of the world’s oil resources.\nThese countries are seeking to shape geopolitics by activist diplomacy in a multipolar world.\nAmong decisions to emerge from the Johannesburg summit was for finance ministers of member countries to explore how to reduce dependence on the US dollar. As Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president put it, “BRICS has embarked on a new chapter to build a world that is fair” and “inclusive”. Whether or not that ambition is realised, the bloc has become an important platform for middle powers to make their global presence felt.\nWhile many middle powers are capitalising on the US-China competition to strengthen their bargaining position they also seek to enhance relations with both global powers. They want to avoid getting in the crosshairs of that confrontation but to also reap advantages from it. This has urged both the US and China to pay more attention to middle powers to ensure they don’t get entrenched in their rival’s camp.\nSaudi Arabia’s recent foreign policy conduct offers a good example of how a middle power is manoeuvring in this geopolitical environment to position itself as a significant global player.\nUnder Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia has pursued initiatives that have set a new foreign policy direction and raised its diplomatic game. Riyadh loosened its traditionally close ties with the US to significantlyboost its economic tieswith China. Its rapprochement with long-time regional rival Iran, brokered by China, greatly increased its leverage with Washington.\nThis development so alarmed the Biden administration that it urged Washington to hasten plans to pursue a ‘grand bargain’ in the Middle East. This involves Saudi Arabia normalising relations with Israel in return for a mutual security pact with the US and Riyadh committing to scale back ties with China. In fact, Riyadh is driving a tough bargain by making several demands — a defence pact with Washington, a civilian nuclear deal, missile defence system/ other high-tech weapons and substantial Israeli concessions for the Palestinians.\nWhether or not this so-called ‘big deal’ materialises it shows how Saudi Arabia has deftly managed to position itself between the two superpowers and wield influence with both. Meanwhile, Riyadh has moved toboost oil prices, to Washington’s annoyance, but at the same time it is poised to join the US-devised infrastructure deal that will connect Arab countries by a railways network.\nTurkey is another country adept at the middle power diplomatic game, which has been widely commented on. A member of Nato, Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has followed an assertive foreign policy in the region and beyond, maintaining ties with both the US and Russia. Ankara has played off the Ukraine conflict to further project its power and increase its leverage. It sought to mediate between Russia and Ukraine and (with the UN) brokered theBlack Sea Grain Dealbetween them in July 2022. This allowed safe passage for shipment of grain from Ukraine, a big exporter, through the Black Sea, whose maritime routes are controlled by Turkey. Ankara also used its leverage over the issue of Nato’s expansion to secure concessions from the US and EU.\nOther middle powers including India have derived similar benefits from their activist diplomacy in a multipolar world. Indeed, their growing role in shaping geopolitics has led some analysts to describe this as the ‘new normal’ at a time when the world is in a state of flux."}]}

Ensure the article presents a nuanced perspective on the subject, incorporates geopolitical insights, and maintains a formal, insightful tone."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "PAKISTAN’S macroeconomic crisis, the most serious in its history, continues to warrant urgent and sustained attention.\nAs is well known, the roots of this crisis lie in chronic fiscal deficits and external imbalances that are responsible for its perpetual balance-of-payments problems, high inflation and macroeconomic instability, necessitating repeated financial bailouts.\nToday, this crisis has to be addressed in an adverse global environment where financial market conditions remain tight. All the economic trends for the country are negative and unlikely to be reversed any time soon.\nInternal and external financial imbalances remain wide, foreign exchange reserves are fragile despite injections of funds from the IMF and friendly countries, inflation is at a historic high, domestic and foreign debt have reached unsustainable levels, the rupee has lost record value against the dollar, exports have fallen, overseas remittances have declined and foreign direct investment has plunged to a new low.\nBut there is another crisis that is worsening and is also consequential for Pakistan’s future. This is the crisis in human development — with most indicators of literacy, education, health and other aspects of social justice and human welfare deteriorating in recent years.\nThe World Bank calls it a “silent, deep human capital crisis”. Its recent report Pakistan Human Capital Review quantifies this crisisand urges increased investment in human capital, pointing out that lack of this will continue to limit the country’s growth and development prospects. Many national and international reports and documents paint a grim picture of the state of human development.\nAccording toUNDP’s Global Human Development Report of 2022, Pakistan’s Human Development Index rank remains at 161 out of 192 countries with no progress recorded from 2019 to 2022. The WB report places Pakistan in the company of sub-Saharan African countries in the Human Capital Index, which at 0.41, is the lowest in South Asia.\nThe country’s education deficit should be treated as an emergency but barely figures in government priorities. No issue is more important for Pakistan’s future than the coverage and quality of education available to our children.\nYet the facts remain dismal. Pakistan has the world’s second-highest number of children, over 20 million (aged five to 16) out of school. Twelve million are girls. It means 44 per cent of children in this age group do not go to school. This violates the constitutional obligation set out in Article 25A that enjoins the state to “provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to 16 years”.\nThe country is sleepwalking into a human development disaster of serious consequences for its future.\nOf those who do go to school dropout rates are high. All this is the result of decades of neglect and chronic underspending on education. Just 2.4pc of GDP makes it among the lowest in South Asia. Only 14 of 195 countries spend less on education than Pakistan. Given Pakistan’s youthful demographic profile and education poverty, young people face a jobless and hopeless future unless the scale and quality of education is expanded.\n\nLiteracy levels have shown little improvement in recent years. Latest available official sources put literacy at 59pc, which means over 40pc of the population are illiterate. The literacy level has been virtually stagnant for the past five years or more, with spending on education also declining. No country has predicated economic progress on an illiterate base. Yet these levels remain largely unchanged.\nIn youth literacy, which is around 75pc, Pakistan is second from the bottom in South Asia. The gender gap is telling. According to thePakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18, almost half of women in the age group 15-25 are uneducated. 61pc of rural women are illiterate.\nThe poverty numbers are equally disturbing. With anaemic growth, soaring inflation (especially food inflation) and limited job creation, poverty has risen and become more severe. Of course, the Covid pandemic and megafloods of 2022 (reflecting the effects of climate change) contributed to this.\nBut the result is that more people have been driven below the poverty line. According to the WB, poverty is estimated to have risen by five percentage points to 39.4pc in FY23, with 12.5m more people pushed into poverty as compared to the previous year.\nOne of the most troubling phenomena is that of child stunting, which theHuman Capital Reviewcalls a “public health crisis”. The report finds around 40pc of Pakistani children under five are stunted — a shocking number.\nThis condemns these children to a life of physical disability, poverty and deprivation and also exposes them to premature mortality. This is mostly the result of malnutrition primarily associated with poverty. Malnourished mothers are more likely to have stunted children. It is also the result of high fertility.\nStunting is worse in Sindh where it is 50pc of under-five children and in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where it is 48pc. Again, this hardly attracts the attention of governments. The HCR report rightly calls for raising the national profile of stunting, which it describes as “a major human capital catastrophe” that merits national and local efforts to address it.\nProgress in gender empowerment has been underwhelming despite some modest gains. Gender gaps in education, health, access to employment, financial services, information, political and other opportunities continue to be wide. In the Human Development Report’s (2022) Gender Inequality Index, Pakistan is ranked 161 out of 191 countries.\nIt does worse in theWorld Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2023, where it is 142 out of 146 countries — among the bottom five countries. In educational attainment it is ranked 138 and at 132 for health and survival. Female labour force participation remains low — among the lowest in Muslim countries — 22pc compared to over 80pc for males. These statistics do not fully capture the multiple deprivations and injustices women face but they do underline how much needs to be done for half the country’s population.\nThe overall picture of various dimensions of human development is so bleak that it suggests Pakistan may be sleepwalking to a disaster that can only be ignored at great peril to the country’s stability, economic progress and prosperity."}]}

But this hardly masked the reality of democratic backsliding that is pervasive in the world today. Pakistan, too, has seen democratic regression.\nMany democracies across the world are challenged by polarisation, intolerance, and toxic politics. They have also seen an erosion of civil liberties and media freedom and the suppression of dissent. This is happening against a backdrop of economic stress and rising but unmet public expectations.\nSeveral reports by international organisations and publications have recorded the global trend of democratic erosion. In its annualDemocracy Report 2023, the V-Dem Institute (based in Sweden) finds democracy has deteriorated in many regions, with the level of democracy enjoyed by the average global citizen having dropped to 1986 levels.\nOver 35 years of international advances in democracy have been wiped out in the last decade. It found there are more “closed autocracies” than liberal democracies for the first time in over two decades, with the current “wave of autocratisation” sweeping across all regions. It also found 72 per cent of the global population (5.7 billion people) live in autocracies — a substantial increase from 46pc a decade ago.\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit conducts an annual survey of the health of democracy in 167 countries, assessing them across five measures. They are electoral processes and pluralism, political participation, a functioning government acting in the public interest, civil liberties and political culture. Its 2022 report concluded that only 8pc people in the world live in a ‘full democracy’, with over a third residing in an authoritarian regime, 37pc in a flawed democracy and 18pc in a hybrid democracy, which is how it classifies Pakistan.\nThe latest edition of theGlobal State of Democracy 2022report by the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) sees a record number of democracies in decline. It calculates over two-thirds of the global population now live in backsliding democracies, authoritarian or hybrid regimes. It attributes the ongoing wave of democratic erosion to the political consequences of the economic crisis that began with the coronavirus pandemic and economic fallout of the war in Ukraine, especially the cost-of-living crisis.\nThe report’s list of backsliding countries includes the US, which faces “problems of political polarisation, institutional dysfunction and threats to civil liberties”. India and Brazil are listed among the rest. It says authoritarian governments have intensified repression with the previous year being the worst on record.\nPakistan is among countries that have seen democratic backsliding.\nA more recentassessmentby Washington-based Freedom House comes to a similar conclusion. It says global freedom declined for the 17th consecutive year with civil liberties and political rights being undermined in several countries. This also involved repression of civil society organisations and worsening of the quality of elections. Forty-seven countries are faced with tighter government censorship of the media while freedom of expression deteriorated in 35 countries last year.\nWhat is apparent is that while many countries still maintain an outward façade of democracy and hold elections of some sort — usually manipulated — they follow illiberal policies, suppress civil liberties, muzzle the media, undermine the rule of law, persecute minority groups and undermine any system of checks and balances that hold governments to account.\nOften described as illiberal democracies, the recent proliferation of such regimes has much to do with the rise of right-wing populism. Populist leaders in a diverse number of countries such as India, the US, Hungary, Poland and Austria, have shown a disregard for democratic institutions and norms, engaged in authoritarian conduct and used hyper-nationalism to rally support, often orchestrating anti-minority sentiment. This has deeply divided and polarised their societies.\nA thoughtfulpiecein a recent edition ofThe Economistnames “paranoid nationalism” among devices used by populist politicians to “prey on their citizens’ fears” in the pursuit of power. This kind of scaremongering is deployed as a tool to “dismantle the checks and balances that underpin good governance: a free press, independent courts, NGOs and a loyal opposition”.\nThe global trend of democratic backsliding raises the question of what might be the underlying factors responsible for this as for the rise of anti-pluralist populist leaders. Each country’s case is different so there is no uniform set of factors. But some common features can be singled out, although this is not an exhaustive list.\nThey include the growing disconnect between political elites and people, failure of established political parties and their policies to meet rising public expectations, poor governance, increasing inequality, lack of response by institutions to public concerns, political polarisation, economic and social discontent spawned by globalisation and the cost-of-living crisis.\nWhat about Pakistan’s experience with democracy — or the lack of it? The country’s troubled political past has seen it swing between long bouts of military rule and periods of fragile civilian democratic governments.\nEven the post-1988 revival of democracy and subsequent ‘democratic decade’ saw interventions by the military-backed president to oust elected governments with none able to complete their term. The bitter feuds between political rivals and lack of tolerance for the opposition enabled the ubiquitous establishment to manipulate politics and undermine democratic rule.\nAnother democratic phase that began in 2008 set a much better record with political leaders showing mutual tolerance and respect for civil liberties and the media being able to function independently in a relatively free and open environment.\nBut the 2018 election ushered in a period of hybrid rule that continues to this day. The post-2018 period has seen democratic regression and reversals as the hybrid arrangement has entailed the military establishment acquiring an expansive role in politics, governance and even the economy. This has been accompanied by mostly politically motivated corruption cases against opposition leaders,jailing of political figuresandactivists, media controls, defiance of the rule of law and marginalisation of parliament.\nThe Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency correctlydescribedthe phase that ended with parliament’s dissolution last month as one of democratic decline, rather than democratic consolidation. The unanswered question is whether the future will be any different."}]}

This provoked a sharp response from PTI, which said elections minus Khan would be “unacceptable, unlawful and unconstitutional”. Others also took exception to this remark.\nThe Human Rights Commission of PakistandescribedKakar’s claim as “ill-judged and anti-democratic” as courts had not yet found Khan guilty in the legal cases against him. HRCP also said it was not for the prime minister or his government to decide unilaterally what constitutes a ‘fair’ election. Former prime minister and PML-N leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also said it was not the interim PM’s job to make such contentious statements.\n\nAn official ‘clarification’ claiming Kakar’s comments had been “misunderstood” and “misreported” did little to quell the controversy. Nor did Kakar’s subsequent explanations. His insistence on being nonpartisan was a response to rising criticism, but it was too little, too late. In fact, his nonstop media interviews on political issues and daily sermons on ‘requirements of the law’ only compounded the matter.\nMeanwhile, remarks by the interim interior minister alsodrew a furious response, this time from leaders of Pakistan’s other major party, PML-N. In an interview, Sarfraz Bugti said Mian Nawaz Sharif would be arrested when he arrived back home from abroad if he failed to get bail. PML-N leaders accused the minister of “exceeding his jurisdiction” and pointed out that it was neither his business nor his decision about where Sharif would go on arrival. Again, a ‘clarification’ by the minister that his government had no “political agenda” did little to calm ruffled feathers.\nEarlier, PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardaridecried the absence of a “level playing field”for the polls. Party representatives publicly assailed the inclusion in the interim cabinet of former bureaucrats closely aligned with PML-N in the past. They insinuated that the interim government was acting as a vehicle for PML-N and also accused the Election Commission of Pakistan of bias.\nThe interim government should focus on creating conditions for free, fair and inclusive elections.\nIf the principal role of a caretaker government is to oversee free and fair polls and act impartially, such criticism from political parties, who are major contenders in the upcoming election, suggests it is already falling short on fulfilling its responsibilities as envisaged in the Constitution and Elections Act of 2017.\nThe gap between how a caretaker government is supposed to act and the conduct of the Kakar administration is evident from what is prescribed by Section 230 of the Elections Act, 2017. It obliges the interim government to be “impartial to every person and political party” and “restrict itself to activities that are of routine, non-controversial and urgent” nature.\nResponsible for managing “day-to-day matters which are necessary to run the affairs of the Government”, it is barred from taking “major policy decisions except on urgent matters”. It cannot take decisions that pre-empt the scope and sphere of activities and powers of the next elected government.\nIt is also not authorised to make appointments or carry out large-scale shuffles of civil servants that can affect the working or policies of the future government. Over the years, the Supreme Court has upheld this principle in rulings on petitions by government employees and others who challenged such transfers. The judgement in the Khwaja Asif case in 2013 is a case in point.\nTrue, an effort was made by the previous parliament to grant more powers to the caretaker government. But because of strident protests from treasury and opposition benches, the Elections (Amendment) Act 2023, adopted last month, was substantially watered down.\nIt only allowed the caretaker administration to take policy decisions on existing multilateral and bilateral agreements and already initiated projects. This did not in any way affect what is set out in the 2017 Act or change the principal function of the caretaker government to assist the ECP in holding elections.\nSeen against this backdrop, there seems little doubt the caretaker government, which has a limited mandate, is over-interpreting its role and acting as if it has been elected and is here to stay. Policy pronouncements on foreign affairs have been frequent, including on sensitive issues on which it has no authority to make decisions.\nPublic claims have been made by ministers about taking decisions which go beyond what is permitted by the law. In fact, ministers seem to be vying for public attention either by making exaggerated claims or issuing disingenuous statements.\nFor example, one cabinet minister claimed he was putting in place policies that would increase Pakistan’s exports (currently under $32 billion a year) to $100bn annually over the next five years! Another minister made similar assertions about enhancing IT exports by an incredible amount and initiating game-changing policies. Some would argue that these hyperbolic statements should be ignored as they mean little. But what they point to and reinforce is an unedifying spectacle of a caretaker government that seems to recognise no restraint on its power and is overstepping its mandate.\nInstead of getting itself embroiled in one controversy after another, the interim government should be focusing on its primary role: creating the conditions for a free, fair and transparent poll. Ministers should steer clear of commenting on political issues, pontificating on foreign policy and desist from seeking pointless publicity all the time.\nFor its part, the ECP should overcome its reticence to announce an election date. Itsannouncementof lists of preliminary delimitation of constituencies is, however, a welcome step.\nThe sooner the country goes to the polls, the greater the chance for it to find a way out of the present political and economic morass and address the multiple crises roiling Pakistan."}]}

Some have been learnt but several of the more consequential ones haven’t. These unlearnt lessons have left the country deeply fractured and in a state of chronic political instability and economic weakness, lurching from one crisis to another.\nThere are at least five unlearnt lessons that have been consequential to the country’s fate and fortu­nes, although this is not an exhaustive list. The first is intensely antagonistic politics that has invo­lved bitter feuds and unremitting confrontations betw­een political leaders and parties. With the war paradigm guiding political conduct, opponents have been seen, not as competitors, but as enemies to be eliminated from the political scene in a terminal conflict. This pattern of behaviour is part of an unedifying tradition, characterised by intolerance and lack of respect for democratic norms.\nThose in power rarely accepted the need to eng­age with the opposition, while those in opposition almost always tried to actively destabilise the government of the day. These power struggles became fatal distractions from governance and meeting public needs. What were essentially intra-elite squabbles — over power and patronage, not policy — created the conditions for the military to intervene and return to the political stage.\nThe repeatedly ignored lesson was that compromise and consensus were essential to achieve civilian supremacy and strengthen democracy. Also overlooked was the risk that endless power tussles would open space for the military to ultimately seize control of the political system. There were always political parties ready to encourage military interventions to remove their opponents. The military for its part easily found political allies to oust civilian governments and aid its takeovers of power.\nThis brings up unlearnt lesson two, relating to military interventions. Pakistan has spent over 30 years of its existence under direct military rule and since 2018 under hybrid ‘democracy’, in which the military has had an expansive role in governance.\nDespite widespread public respect for the military in its professional role, its political interventions have lacked public legitimacy. The lesson from long bouts of military rule is that these constitutional transgressions neither found public acceptance nor delivered what they promised — political stability and economic progress. Instead, they produced deleterious consequences for the country and undermined the military’s reputation. That is why today the military acknowledges that military rule is neither an option nor a ‘solution’.\nHistory has repeated itself in Pakistan as both farce and tragedy.\nBut a hybrid system is also problematic. The lesson of the hybrid experience, that further skewed the civil-military balance and involved democratic regression, is that it is inherently unable to provide coherent and effective governance.\n\nIt fragments the governance system, creates confusion about lines of authority and also distracts the military from its professional role, especially when the security situation needs its undivided attention. The hybrid experiment of 2018-2022 hardly built economic or political stability; quite the opposite in fact. Continuing this ‘model’ will not yield an outcome different from the past.\nThe third lesson is that unless the country undertakes wide-ranging reforms to address its long-standing structural economic problems it cannot escape from the trap of chronic fiscal deficits, balance-of-payments problems, high inflation and macroeconomic instability, which have necessitated repeated financial bailouts.\nThe reliance on outsiders —‘friendly’ countriesand IMF — for bailouts has been a short-term fix, not a solution. For decades, dysfunctional economic management by both civilian and military governments evaded reform and resisted mobilising adequate domestic resources. Instead, resort to excessive borrowing at home and abroad mired Pakistan in unsustainable debt and perpetual financial crises. The country’s foreign alignments were frequently leveraged to secure financial help — often dubbed geopolitical rent — to overcome the crisis of the day.\n\nSo serious is Pakistan’s economic crisis today that the lesson it offers can be ignored only at great peril to the country. The old way of managing public finances is no longer tenable. There is an urgent need to deal with the structural sources of persisting financial imbalances: a narrow and inequitable tax regime, limited export base, energy sector’s circular debt, bankrupt public-sector enterprises, heavy regulatory burden and low savings and investment.\nThe fourth lesson has to do with the failure to in­­­vest in human capital. This has left the country with deteriorating social indicators and at the bottom of global human development rankings. Unde­rinvestment has meant 40 per cent of Pakistanis are illiterate, 22 million school-age children are out of school, poverty has risen to almost 40pc while health indicators including malnutrition levels remain grim. Pakistan cannot achieve economic growth and progress by failing to invest in its people.\nLesson five concerns how the state has dealt with religious extremism and militancy over the decades. Of course, violent extremism has had both internal and external drivers.\nGen Ziaul Haq’s Isla­misation policies in the 1980s dangerously divided society along religious and sectarian lines. His patronisation of certain extremist groups — along with fallout from the Afghan war — proved consequential, leading to the rise of militancy in the1990s. State tolerance and leniency towards such groups emboldened them and heightened the threat to the country’s security.\nFast forward to 2007 and thetakeover of Islamabad’s Lal Masjidby militants. This was a turning point at a time when Pakistan was cooperating in the US-led ‘war on terror’ in Afgha­nistan. Thereafter assorted militant groups declared war on Pakistan including the Tehreek-i-Taliban, which was formed in that period.\nAlthough Pakistan’s security forces have since undertaken effective campaigns to defeat militancy, the need remains for a consistent and holistic strategy that doesn’t just rely on kinetic actions. There is also a wider lesson from Pakistan’s experience with extremism.\nToo often governments sought to appease extremists or waver when faced with agitation by religious zealots. Succumbing to pressure to bring an end to the crisis of the day emboldened extremist forces, only for them to repeatedly rear their head to challenge the state.\nThe lessons from these different aspects of Pakistan’s experience should not be hard to learn and act upon. Doing that offers the best and perhaps only chance for the country to free itself from the dead hand of the past."}]}

The conditions for thistragic turn of eventswere created by Israel’s brutal occupation of Palestine for over seven decades.\nIsrael’s forever ‘war’ on the Palestinians has involved intensifying aggression against the Palestinian people, settler violence, human rights atrocities, desecration of Muslim holy places and the most vicious form of apartheid in modern history.\nPalestinians have been forced out of their homeland, deprived of their land and subjected to unceasing repression, arbitrary arrests and collective punishment. They have seen entire neighbourhoods demolished and people uprooted to make way for illegal Israeli settlements.\nThis has inflicted untold suffering on a dispossessed and displaced people. Gaza’s over two million inhabitants have struggled for 16 years with an Israeli-imposed blockade and cruel restrictions that have wreaked havoc in their lives in a territory described as the world’slargest open-air prison.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of historical injustice, it was no surprise for the combustible situation to explode with theOct 7 military assaulton Israel by the Palestinian resistance group, Hamas. Israel’s ferocious and indiscriminate retaliation added another grim chapter to Palestine’s tragedy.\nIsrael vowed “mighty revenge” andimposed a siegeon Gaza. It unleashed its firepower on a narrow, impoverished, densely populated strip of territory, carrying out unrelenting bombing of residential buildings, refugee camps and schools — a war crime. This claimed over 2,200 Palestinian lives, including 700 children, and displaced close to half a million people.\nThe UN human rights chiefcalledthe siege a contravention of international humanitarian law. The EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell also described Israel’s siege of Gaza as illegal. By cutting off electricity, water, food and fuel supplies to Gaza, Israel created a dire situation. Its military also ordered 1.1m people to leave northern Gaza. A humanitarian catastrophe is now unfolding with the UN warning of calamitous consequences.\nAs this tragedy unfolded the international community did little. Unconcerned by the Palestinian plight, Western countries declared their unconditional support for ‘Israel’s right to defend itself’. The US, Israel’s principal benefactor, announced more military assistance for Tel Aviv, sent an aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean and dispatched “advanced armaments”. While no one should condone the killing of innocent civilians by either side, Western governments didn’t utter a word about civilian Palestinian casualties, expressing outrage only at the loss of Israeli lives.\nAs Israeli air strikes continued, reducing entire neighbourhoods to rubble, the OIC issued astatementcondemning the “continuing Israeli military aggression against the Palestinian people” and proclaimed that continuing occupation is the cause of instability.\nBut the 57-member organisation of Muslim states contemplated no collective action. Nor were Arab countries, who in recent years established diplomatic relations with Israel, asked to suspend those ties. In fact, their normalisation policy towards Israel emboldened Tel Aviv to act with the impunity it has in its war on Gaza. An emergency Arab League meeting demanded Israel end its siege of Gaza and left it at that.\nOnce again, the UN Security Council failed to live up to its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It met in emergency (closed) session on Oct 8 to discuss the situation but this ended indeadlockwhen the Council was unable to even issue a statement. Western countries are reported to have only wanted harsh condemnation of Hamas and showed no interest in calling for de-escalation.\nThe Russian representative pressed in vain for the Council to call for a ceasefire and “meaningful negotiations”. A second Security Council meeting on Oct 13 also saw sharp disagreements. Russia proposed a “humanitarian ceasefire” and circulated a resolution urging this and protection of civilians. It got no traction from the P3 — US, UK and France — and with a vote on it yet to be scheduled, action on this is unlikely. This has left the Council derelict in its duty to bring a halt to the violence.\nThis wasn’t the first time the UN body was unable to act on an issue that, like the Kashmir dispute, has been on the agenda of the UN almost since its inception. Scores of UNSC and General Assembly resolutions have called for a resolution of the issue and an end to the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine. There are at least 88 Security Council resolutions on the Palestine question.\n\nThe answer to the dispute, the oldest on the UN agenda, has long been spelt out in several resolutions — a two-state solution that ensures a viable, independent and contiguous State of Palestine.\nBut Israel was encouraged years back by blanket Western support, especially former US presidentDonald Trump’s policiesto abandon the two-state ‘solution’ and instead seek to impose a one-state ‘solution’, expanding illegal settlements in violation of Security Council resolutions and defiance of international demands to cease this activity.\nInaction on these resolutions is an indictment of those members of the global community who possess the power to change the situation but are unwilling to act because of a blind commitment to Israel and contrary to their claims to respect international law.\nFor his part, UN Secretary General António Guterres said the most recent flare-up of violence “does not come in a vacuum” but “grows out of a long-standing conflict, with a 56-year-long occupation with no end in sight”. He urged an end to the bloodshed and asserted that “only a negotiated peace” reflecting the “long-held vision of a two-state solution, in line with UN resolutions — can bring long-term stability to the people of this land and the wider Middle East region.” He also urged Israel to “reconsider” its evacuation order.\nSuch entreaties fell on deaf ears in Israel. With Israel planning a ground invasion and reoccupation of Gaza the outcome of the crisis is unclear with the danger of regionalisation of the war. What seems certain is that efforts at regional normalisation, notably between Saudi Arabia and Israel, are for now dead in the water.\nAlso apparent is the lesson of the past several decades — no amount of firepower and repression can break an occupied people’s will to resist."}]}

Meanwhile, the US role in the crisis has come into sharper focus due to two key developments. One, President Joe Biden’svisit to Israelin the midst of the war. And two, the US veto of a UN Security Council resolution seeking a “humanitarian pause” in the war, which followed itsrejectionof another resolution calling for a ceasefire.\nBiden’s visit took place in the immediate aftermath of thedeadly Israeli strike on Al Ahli hospital in Gazathat claimed the lives of almost 500 people. The massacre was condemned across the world and deemed a war crime by international legal experts. A group of independent UN experts said the strikes amounted to collective punishment prohibited by international humanitarian law. Arriving in Tel Aviv when Israel was continuing to bomb Gaza and the UN warned of a looming catastrophe, Biden said he had come to show solidarity and the US would forever stand with Israel. Whether or not some of this was about domestic American politics in election year, his one-sided stance was devoid of any empathy for the suffering of Gaza’s Palestinians or concern about further escalation of the war. Worse, without producing a shred of evidence, he agreed with Israel’s claim that Palestinian militants were responsible for the strike on the hospital.\n\nWhile anger mounted at the US in the Arab street, Biden’s Middle East diplomacy floundered. Jordan’s King Abdullah and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas cancelled their meetings with the American president. Amman was to host a four-way summit with Biden, Egyptian and Palestinian leaders. But this was called off in the wake of the hospital bombing, which King Abdullah described as “a heinous war crime”. Jordan’s foreign minister said the meeting would be held only when the parties agree to end the “war and the massacres against Palestinians”. The diplomatic setback for the US was compounded by the blow to its credibility in the region. The Biden visit came to be widely seen in the Middle East and beyond as giving Israel carte blanche to carry out more bombings and encouraging escalation rather than defusing the crisis.\nThe longer Israel’s war on Gaza continues, the higher the risk of a wider conflict.\nIsrael has since intensified its bombing campaign in Gaza and carried out multiple raids into the West Bank which erupted in protests against Israel. It also carried out air strikes on residential buildings, churches and a refugee camp in Gaza. The Biden administration seemed oblivious to the destabilising repercussions of its policy. It failed to see the hospital bombing had become a turning point in the crisis and miscalculated the international response to Israel’s actions, including growing calls for a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities — from governments and people. Washington also discounted the consequences of ‘guilt by association’ with Israel’s military operations because of its blanket support for Tel Aviv.\n\nUS conduct in two UN Security Council meetings further reinforced the growing impression around the world that Washington was doing nothing to de-escalate the explosive situation. First it opposed a Russian resolution calling for a ceasefire, saying this did not name Hamas. The resolution failed to secure enough votes to pass. Another resolution, moved by Brazil, calling for a “humanitarian pause” in the war to allow delivery of lifesaving aid to Gaza and also condemning Hamas, received an overwhelming majority of votes — 12 of 15. But the US envoy vetoed the resolution on the grounds that it did not recognise Israel’s right to self-defence. Washington’s refusal to call for a ceasefire or urge restraint on Israel was seen across countries as an endorsement of Tel Aviv’s military actions. This was reinforced by Biden’s move to ask Congress for billions of dollars in “unprecedented” military aid for Israel.\nNot surprisingly, the catastrophic situation in Gaza and images of death and devastation following the hospital bombing intensified anti-Israel and anti-US protests as public fury erupted across the world. There was anunprecedented surgein popular solidarity with the Palestinians. This was unsurprising in Muslim countries even if large rallies exceeded those in the past. But many cities in the West also saw big pro-Palestine demonstrations. This wave of global public support for the Palestinians offered a sharp contrast to the position adopted by Western governments.\nIt is uncertain how the war in Gaza will play out. The key question is what will happen once Israel goes ahead with a ground offensive in Gaza especially as its leaders are also promising a long war. The longer the conflict continues the greater the risk of it spilling over several fronts. The UN envoy for the Middle East told the Security Council last week that “the risk of an expansion of this conflict is very real and extremely dangerous”.\nIsrael hasbombed Syria’s two main airports. There has been anexchange of fireacross the Lebanese border. Atrocities against Gaza’s civilians are mounting pressure on Hezbollah in Lebanon to join the conflict. An Israeli ground invasion of Gaza might force Hezbollah to get involved. Should that happen, it would draw in others and likely result in US intervention. Washington has already sent weapons to Israel and deployed two aircraft carrier strike groups in the eastern Mediterranean ostensibly to ‘deter’ Hezbollah and its ally Iran from entering the conflict. American bases in Iraq and Syria have come under drone attack, for which a militant group claimed responsibility citing US support for Israel. A US warship intercepted missiles apparently launched from Yemen. For its part, Iran has warned of “pre-emptive action” to deter Israel’s ground invasion into Gaza.\nArab countries have called for an end to the war and denounced Israeli actions. But pressure is mounting on them from enraged publics to go beyond statements. While no one wants a regional conflagration, so long as Israel continues on an escalatory course that risk will heighten because that would reshape the responses of neighbouring countries. The only way to avert this is an immediate ceasefire and de-escalation. For that to happen the US would have to shift course and prioritise regional peace and justice over blind support for Israel."}]}

The country’s political history is punctuated by dramatic reversals in the political fortunes of leaders.\nLike other politicians who made remarkable comebacks, Sharif has also been a political survivor. Over two decades ago, when he was exiled following a military coup, many believed this would mark the end of his political career. That didn’t happen. He returned to win the 2013 election and become prime minister for the third time.\n\nAfter four years abroad, he is now back to participate in the election, expected in January 2024, and make a bid for prime ministership for the fourth time.\nSharif’s long career in politics has seen many highs and lows. He was never able to complete any of his terms as prime minister as he was ousted either by the military or the president (when that office had the constitutional power to do so).\nThe last time he was prime minister, he was forced to step down in 2017 after hisdisqualificationon dubious grounds by the Supreme Court and his falling out with the military establishment. His party survived its leader’s many trials and troubles, but when challenged by Imran Khan’s PTI, Sharif’s absence from the country proved damaging for PML-N.\n\nEven though the party led the PDM coalition that assumed power after Khan’s ouster, his brother Shehbaz Sharif neither had the popular appeal nor political skill to effectively lead and reinvigorate the party.\nPML-N lost considerable ground in its stronghold of Punjab owing to its poor management of an economy mired in the worst crisis in the country’s history, although this was the cumulative result of years of dysfunctional policies and political instability. Incumbency nonetheless exacted a price.\nMounting inflation fuelled public discontent and eroded PML-N’s support, while the party itself became divided and factionalised. But the party has also seen longer-term decline in support. From a high of 59 per cent of the popular vote polled in Punjab in 1997 (in the National Assembly election), the party got 47pc in the 2013 election and 35pc in 2018. Although the last election was disputed, PML-N still managed to secure a large number of seats.\nThis presents Sharif with the challenge of reinventing the party and overhauling it — in terms of image, purpose and organisation. It needs a new narrative that can capture the public imagination and is predicated on the future, not the past. It is no longer enough to work networks of rural and urban notables or ‘electables’ who use their local power or biradari connections to rally support.\nPML-N was always adept at this, but in Pakistan’s changed environment, it is insufficient to deal with new dynamics. PML-N needs to fashion a message to inspire voters that offers policy solutions to Pakistan’s problems. The party also needs to reconfigure its team and not just rely on faces from the 1990s.\nThe PML-N leader faces multiple challenges, including reinventing his party.\nIn hisvery first public addresson his homecoming, Nawaz Sharif spent a good deal of time on the past — recalling the injustice meted out to him, the personal price he and his family paid and his contributions to the country’s infrastructure and economic development when in power.\nHe also made it clear that serving the people, not revenge, would be his mission, and pledged to rebuild Pakistan. He referred to the economic challenge but didn’t say how he planned to address this and other problems, leaving that for another day. This is what people expect to hear in the election campaign, which will be crucial for PML-N’s revival.\nWhat Nawaz Sharif will realise in the coming days is that he has returned to a very different Pakistan — politically, socially and economically. The country is deeply polarised with a fragmented polity.\nKhan’s populism, PTI’s continuing popularity and its anti-establishment politics have transformed the political landscape. So has its mobilisation of youth, who will be a key factor in elections, especially as young people now constitute 47pc of the electorate. An assertive urban middle class that wants a bigger voice in politics and governance has also created a new political dynamic. So has social media. PML-N will have to discard its traditional ways of doing politics if it is to be in sync with these changes.\nThen there is the hybrid political system in place today in which the civil-military power balance has shifted decisively to the military. Adapting to this will be another challenge for Sharif, who in his Lahore speech adopted a conciliatory tone urging “harmony among institutions”.\n\nNawaz Sharif has also returned in a very fraught economic environment. The country narrowly averted debt default just months ago. The economy is still on life support. The need for continuing fiscal tightening seriously limits any government’s ability to ease people’s economic plight in the near term.\nHow the economy is managed is the single most important issue for people who expect him to propose solutions to fix the economy. That in turn would depend on whether Sharif is prepared to jettison the old guard and reach out to younger members for fresh ideas. The country desperately needs an economic vision and a home-grown plan of sweeping reforms to address the structural problems responsible for its perennial financial crises.\nThe PML-N leader also has to deal with legal problems, as he hasconvictionsin two cases he describes as politically motivated. These convictions mean he cannot contest elections and is disqualified from holding public office.Appealsfiled by his legal counsel in the Islamabad High Court to set aside these convictions are expected to be heard in coming weeks.\n\nThe disqualification issue may involve a somewhat longer legal process that ultimately involves the Supreme Court overruling its earlier decision that disqualified Sharif for life. If that happens, the law passed by parliament reducing the disqualification period to five years will kick in and Sharif will be eligible for public office.\nWhile he enjoys the establishment’s support, Nawaz Sharif has a slew of imposing challenges to negotiate. This suggests his arduous journey back to power has only just begun."}]}

Clearly, the UN Security Council failed in its duty to stop hostilities. This from a world body whose primary responsibility is to maintain international peace and security.\nIts inability to pass resolutions calling for a truce or humanitarian pause exposed the polarisation among its members which paralysed the Council. The US was the principal stumbling block in efforts to achieve a ceasefire. Its unconditional support for Israel handed Tel Aviv carte blanche to continue its barbaric military campaign in utter disregard for world opinion.\nThe Security Council’s inaction led to an emergency session of the General Assembly, which approved, by an overwhelming majority, a resolution calling for a truce. Only the US and a handful of countries voted ‘no’. While this resolution has moral and political weight and aimed to mount diplomatic pressure on Israel and its backers, it is non-binding. Therefore, it could do nothing to end Israel’s war on Gaza.\nThese developments demonstrated America’s increasing diplomatic isolation as several of its Western allies joined most of the international community to back an immediate ceasefire. While some European countries shifted their position to voice concern for the humanitarian crisis and loss of Palestinian lives, Washington refused to ask Israel to cease its bombardments or lift the siege of Gaza, showing indifference to the devastating humanitarian consequences of Israeli actions.\nUN officials repeatedly declared that Israeli violence directed at over two million Palestinians trapped in Gaza was collective punishment and violated international humanitarian law. But the US and its Western partners only called out Hamas for the attack on Israel and accepted Israel’s carpet bombing of an entire population as Israel’s ‘right to defend itself’.\nThey showed no compassion for thousands of Palestinian casualties, who were portrayed as human shields for Hamas — an egregious example of dehumanising Palestinians. President Joe Biden even questioned Palestinian casualty figures saying he had “no confidence in the numbers the Palestinians are using”. When Washington began to voice concern for civilian deaths it was too little, too late especially as it continued to oppose a ceasefire.\n\nThese developments laid bare the US-led West’s hypocrisy. While Western leaders denounced Russian military actions and targeting of civilians in Ukraine, they refused to apply the same principle to Gaza.\nThe EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen once characterised Russia’s “attacks on civilian infrastructure” that aimed to deprive people of water and electricity as “acts of pure terror”. But neither she nor any Western leader chose to describe Israel’s action of cutting off electricity, water, food and fuel supplies to Gaza in a similar way.Nor did Israel’s use of white phosphorous in indiscriminate artillery attacks urge Western governments to denounce this violation of international humanitarian law.\nThere was no Western condemnation of Israel’s attacks on Jabalia refugee camp in which scores of people were killed and for which Tel Aviv claimed responsibility, justifying civilian deaths as a ‘tragedy of war’.\nPublic outrage over the humanitarian disaster is in sharp contrast to the position of Western governments.\nWestern countries who claim to be standard bearers of human rights and constantly lecture other countries on this adopted a deafening silence on Israeli atrocities and genocidal actions. This display of double standards was not new. Western concern for human rights has always been selective, its criticism usually directed at adversaries and opponents, while friendly countries have been shielded from censure.\nGermany and France imposed a ban on pro-Palestinian rallies in a bid to criminalise expressions of sympathy for Palestinians. This made a mockery of their democratic credentials and showed the shallowness of their commitment to freedom of expression. In the US, donors threatened to cut off funding to universities where students rallied in solidarity with Palestinians.\nThe Guardianreportedthat prominent American figures from magazine editors to Hollywood agents faced sackings or rebuke for supporting Palestinians. Elsewhere in Europe, pro-Palestinian activists were hounded on the pretext of being antisemitic. In the UK, Home Secretary Suella Braverman branded pro-Palestinian demonstrations as “hate marches’, called for curbs on protests and urged criminalising waving the Palestinian flag. All this in so-called democracies who claim civilisational superiority over countries of the Global South.\nThe Western media’s role has been as one-sided as that of their governments and blind to the suffering of the Palestinian people. Major networks echoed Israeli propaganda and mostly covered the war from the prism of ‘Israel’s right to defend itself’. Western TV anchors seemed to read from the same script and disregarding massacres carried out by Israel, kept asking interviewees if they condemned Hamas.\n\nThe most flagrant example of disinformation spread by Western channels was of Israeli babies beheaded by Hamas, which had no basis in fact. Only when the scale of killings in Gaza could not be ignored and criticism of their bias mounted did networks such as BBC change course to cover these. Meanwhile, Western social media companies censored Palestinian content, as confirmed by international human rights organisations including Amnesty.\nThe response from Muslim countries neither matched the catastrophic situation on the ground nor met the expectations of their own people. Other than diplomatic activism at the UN to secure a General Assembly resolution, it did not go beyond issuing denunciations of Israel. While several South American countries cut ties with Israel only Jordan and Bahrain did so from among Arab states who had established diplomatic relations with Tel Aviv.\nDoes all this mean the Palestinians have been abandoned? Yes and no. Yes, because the international community failed to stop the carnage in Gaza. No, because across the world, from west to east, people came out in unprecedently large numbers to show solidarity with the Palestinians and demand a ceasefire.\nPublic outrage over the humanitarian disaster expressed in protest rallies was in sharp contrast to the pusillanimous position adopted by their governments. Public opinion in the US was also at sharp variance with the Biden administration’s stance. A Data for Progress poll found 66 per cent of American voters supported a ceasefire.\nThe consequences of the biggest disaster to befall the Palestinian people since 1948 will be far-reaching for the region and for the world. I will take that up in another column."}]}

The announcement of an election date ended the prolonged political uncertainty in the country. But doubts persist about whether the election would be free and fair.\nIt is unclear if the polls will be inclusive and whether there will be a level playing field for everyone to contest freely. Doubts have been reinforced by the renewed, ongoing wave of arrests of members of Imran Khan’s PTI. Nearly all its top leaders are now in jail. The party hasconveyeda list of obstacles to the Election Commission of Pakistan which it argues will constrain its ability to freely conduct its election campaign.\nAn opinion survey conducted by Gallup-Pakistan in June 2023 found only a quarter of Pakistanis expressed enough confidence in the fairness and transparency of the upcoming election.\nThe majority of respondents had little faith in the integrity of the polls. This kind of public scepticism can deter voter participation and contribute to a low voter turnout, which can undermine the election’s legitimacy. That makes it imperative for the election to be credible and transparent.\nPakistan’s history of disputed elections offers a cautionary tale about the destabilising consequences of electoral exercises marred by irregularities and ballot fraud. If the February election becomes controversial in another exercise in what is euphemistically called ‘political engineering’ it will undermine political and economic stability, which Pakistan can ill afford.\nThe country today faces a multiplicity of challenges — weak governance, economic stagnation, mounting inflation, rising threats to internal security, education deficit, uncontrolled population growth and erosion of the institutional capacity of the apparatus of governance.\nThese vexing issues need to be urgently addressed. The electorate’s expectation is for participants in the electoral race to offer solutions to these problems, especially how the country can achieve economic recovery. The public want political leaders to lay out a road map of where they want to take the country.\n\nThis should urge politicians to see the election not just as a means to secure power but an opportunity to empower themselves to meet the country’s challenges. This is especially because politics in recent years has increasingly been issue-less, focused on power struggles and denigration of opponents rather than matters of public concern.\nA fractured vote can deny any single party a majority and produce a hung parliament.\nIt is much too early to assess where parties stand on different issues and whether their leaders have given careful thought to issues pivotal to Pakistan’s economic and political future. Party manifestos have yet to be issued. But they are usually full of platitudes, which makes them indistinguishable between parties.\nWill parties now inject substance into their manifestos and offer a coherent, implementable programme given the imposing challenges Pakistan faces today? Also important is how seriously political leaders will speak to the country’s challenges and spell out their policy priorities during the campaign.\nAt least three aspects of the election will be noteworthy. The first is voter turnout. This could be an important indicator of how free and open the electoral process is perceived by people. A low turnout would have a bearing on the strength or otherwise of the winning party’s mandate to govern.\n\nTurnout in past elections has ranged between 51 per cent (2018), 53pc (2013), 44pc (2008) and 41pc (2002). The lowest — in 2002 — reflected the electorate’s lack of confidence in an election held under military rule, which was neither deemed to be free nor fair. If turnout drops considerably below, say, 44pc, those who secure public office by a minority vote resting on a low turnout will have questionable representative credentials.\nThe second key factor in the upcoming elections will be the youth vote. The July 2023 figures from the ECP show that voters between the ages of 18 to 35 constitute 45pc of the electorate — 57,095,197 out of 126,980,272 (latest unpublished statistic on the size of the electorate is around 128 million).\nThis reflects the country’s youthful demographic profile and makes young voters a significant factor in determining the election outcome. ECP statistics also show that about 22m new voters have been added to the electoral rolls since the 2018 election. That’s a significant 18pc of the electorate. Most are young, first-time voters. Who they vote for will be consequential to the result.\nAnother area to watch would be the expected four-way fight in the battleground province of Punjab — primarily between PML-N and PTI, but with the PPP (in a much weaker position in the province) and the newish Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (comprising mostly deserters from PTI) also in the fray. It is too soon to say how alignments and seat-adjustment deals will shape the contest. But if it is a four-cornered race, marginal seats would be even more fiercely contested.\n\nThere is a sizeable number of marginal and tightly fought seats in Pakistan’s first-past-the-post system. Well over 100 National Assembly seats were won by a plurality, not majority of votes in the2018 election. Eighty-seven National Assembly seats were won by a margin of less than 1,000 votes, and 26 seats by a margin of under 2,000 votes.\nIn 51 constituencies, the winning candidate’s margin of victory was under 6,000 votes. Most of these were in Punjab — where general elections are won or lost. With the average size of Punjab’s national constituencies around 900,000 today, these are fragile margins of victory.\nGiven these margins, young voters can tip the outcome if they participate in the election in significant numbers. In any case, the prospect of vote splintering will make the result in many constituencies harder to predict than in the past. More importantly, a fractured vote can deny any single party a majority and make another hung parliament likely.\nWith elections less than three months away, a mixture of hope and anxiety characterises the public mood. Hope that the election will end the drift and disarray of recent years and provide a fresh mandate to the winning party to tackle Pakistan’s challenges. But also, apprehension that if the election is not inclusive and lacks integrity it will denude the country of the stability it desperately needs."}]}

Backed by tanks, the ground assault rained down terror on terrified patients at the hospital, endangering the lives of people, including thousands of civilians sheltering there.\nEyewitnesses spoke of Israeli soldiers destroying medical equipment, interrogating medical staff at gunpoint as well as stripping, blindfolding and detaining people, who were taken to unknown locations. Its pretext for the raid was that the hospital was a base for Hamas — a patent lie. No credible evidence was produced for the claim that, in any case, did not justify the hospital attack, prohibited by international humanitarian law.\nAs the horrific invasion of the hospital unfolded condemnations came from countries across the world. UN officials, global aid and human rights organisations slammed the action.\nBoth the UN’s relief chief Martin Griffiths and head of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said, “Hospitals are not battlegrounds”, and that “protection of newborns, patients, medical staff and all civilians must override all other concerns”. As global criticism mounted, the White House denied it gave Israel a green light for the military raid.\nA day earlier a US administration spokesman announced it had intelligence information that supported Israeli claims of Hamas using Al Shifa hospital for its military operations. But he offered no substantiation.\nSubsequently, President Joe Biden defended the raid despite global outrage at the action and without providing proof that the hospital was a Hamas command centre.\nThe raid on Al Shifa took place in the sixth week of Israel’s war on Gaza which has left over 11,500 Palestinians dead, including 4,600 children. Over 1.5 million people have been forcibly displaced. Despite the growing global clamour for a ceasefire, US refusal to support a truce has stood in the way of bringing hostilities to an end.\nAt the UN, the Security Council considered another resolution to address the humanitarian dimension of the war. After four failed attempts to pass a resolution, a fifth draft was moved by Malta calling for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses” in Gaza for “a sufficient number of days” to allow full and unhindered access for UN agencies and partners.\nIt was adopted by 12 votes of the 15-member Security Council. The US and UK abstained as the resolution did not condemn Hamas. Russia abstained as it did not provide for a ceasefire.\n\nHumanitarian ‘pauses’ will not halt the genocide and forced displacement perpetrated by Israel. They are no substitute for a ceasefire. Ostensibly aimed at protecting civilians especially children, these pauses can only provide narrow windows to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. But as Israel has long defied UNSC resolutions, Tel Aviv is unlikely to abide by it even though it is legally binding.\nThe Israeli ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan denounced the resolution as “meaningless”, indicating his country will not comply with it. The Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour expressed his disappointment with the resolution stressing that what was needed was a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities. The Security Council’s first action since the war began failed to match the catastrophic situation on the ground.\nThe international community has failed the people of Gaza.\nNevertheless, with Israel escalating deadly bombings in Gaza, intensifying raids into the West Bank and Palestinian casualties mounting, the White House came under growing pressure from dissent within the US administration, public protests demanding a ceasefire and growing disquiet among its allies.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called for a ceasefire and said Israel must stop bombing and killing babies and women in Gaza. Cracks in the G7 were also evident from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s call to Israel to end the “killing of women, of children, of babies” in the besieged Gaza Strip.\nHowever, this has yet to affect Washington’s unconditional backing for Israel. This was evident from Biden’s remarks at his presser after the meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in San Francisco. He reiterated his opposition to a ceasefire and defended Israel’s military campaign. He again accused Hamas of beheading babies, even though earlier reports of this proved to be totally false, which the White House too had acknowledged.\n\nHe also said Israel’s war in Gaza will only end when the military capacity of Hamas is degraded. Any hope that the US would restrain Israel seemed to fade by these pronouncements. This despite poll findings in the US that indicate most Americans want a ceasefire. AReuters/Ipsos poll foundover two-thirds of people backed a ceasefire and that support for Israel was waning.\nA striking aspect of the war has been the extent of disinformation and deliberate lies Israeli leaders and its military have spread, which have been echoed unquestionably by much of the Western media. Worse, some publications have totally disregarded Palestinian casualties, with few exceptions.\nThe Economistarguedthat Israel must fight on, regardless of the civilian death toll and disingenuously described a ceasefire as an “enemy of peace”. Other news publications justified Israel’s relentless, brutal bombardments of refugee camps and hospitals as its ‘right to defend itself’. The dehumanisation of Palestinians has characterised much of the coverage by the Western media.\nWith their sentiments inflamed by nonstop bloodshed in Gaza, Muslim publics across the world weren’t surprised by the Western media’s biased coverage as that was nothing new. Their deep disappointment lay with Arab governments who, beyond issuing condemnations, acted as little more than spectators to a genocide and epic humanitarian catastrophe.\nReports that some Arab countries opposed and prevented even minimal actions proposed by other states, which could have mounted significant diplomatic pressure on Israel and the US, only added to the popular discontent. Inaction by Arab and Muslim governments represented in the OIC was widely seen as a betrayal of the Palestinians. But then, it is the entire international community that has failed the people of Gaza.\nIt has singularly failed in its response to what UN Secretary General António Guterres has called a “crisis of humanity”."}]}

But it yielded a welcome thaw in their long frosty relations.\nTheir meeting on the sidelines of theAsia Pacific Economic (APEC) forumin San Francisco was their first face-to-face interaction in over a year, and ranged over bilateral and global issues and all the contentious areas that divide them. Both sides saw the summit as an opportunity to stabilise ties, which in recent years have sunk to an all-time low.\nThe meeting was preceded by a series of visits to Beijing by top American officials, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, CIA chief Bill Burns and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also visited Washington in October. These multiple diplomatic engagements helped to bring down the temperature and also create a helpful environment for the California summit.\nNo big breakthrough was anticipated at the summit. And there wasn’t one. However, agreement on several fronts marked a step towards easing tensions, holding out the possibility of building on the modest progress achieved for a more predictable and stable relationship.\n\nImprovement in the tone of the relationship was significant, with positive vibes from both sides. Xi told Biden that the “planet was big enough” for both the global powers. Biden spoke of the need to responsibly manage the competition “so it doesn’t result in conflict”.\nHe also said that “a stable relationship between the world’s two largest economies is not merely good for the two economies but for the world”.\nIn his solo press conference, Biden later repeated a remark hemade earlier this yearthat he saw Xi as a “dictator”. This provoked an angry response from Beijing but did not detract from the diplomatic advance made at the summit. The Chinese media described the meeting as “a new starting point” for bilateral relations.\nChina’s foreign ministry spokeswoman called the summit “a positive, comprehensive and constructive meeting of strategic and far-reaching significance”.\nThe three areas where the two sides were able to reach agreement were: to restore high-level military-to-military communication, establish a presidential hotline, and cooperate to restrict the production of fentanyl, a precursor chemical responsible for drug overdoses in the US.\nRe-establishing military relations,suspendedby Beijing since 2022, was, of course, the most significant. This means the resumption of China-US Defence Policy Coordination Talks, China-US Military Maritime Consultative Agreement meetings, and telephonic contact between theatre commanders.\nIf implemented without hurdles, this should help to reduce the risk of miscalculation, especially given the fraught situation in the South China Sea, where both sides have air and naval deployments.\nThe future trajectory of this critical relationship has far-reaching repercussions for the world.\nThe agreement on counter-narcotics involved China’s commitment to check the production of fentanyl precursors to prevent their ending up with drug cartels and contributing to America’s drug problem.\nBiden is reported to have conveyed his appreciation for Xi’s commitment, while also saying he would “trust but verify” Chinese actions in this regard. The creation of a counter-narcotics working group is expected to coordinate these efforts.\nCooperation in these areas and the mutual desire to strengthen communication channels may help to halt the slide in China-US relations. But while the talks were said to be wide-ranging and also covered the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the summit didn’t see differences between the two global powers narrowing over the major issues and disputes that drive tensions in their strategic competition — Taiwan, trade, technology curbs and military postures. Indeed, both sides used the summit to again spell out their positions and red lines on Taiwan.\nXi told Biden to cease arming Taiwan and reiterate that reunification was inevitable. The Chinese foreign ministry readout later said Beijing expected the US side to now “follow through on its statement of not supporting Taiwan independence and support China’s peaceful reunification”.\n\nBiden called for restraint by China on Taiwan while reiterating US support for its ‘One China’ policy. Western analysts noted that Biden seemed to step back from his tough rhetoric of a year ago, when he repeatedly referred to China’s coercive posture on Taiwan, and in a departure from previous US policy, even said American forces would intervene militarily to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.\nTaiwan, however, continues to be a dangerous flashpoint in the China-US confrontation. This was laid bare earlier this year when there was a near collision in June between a Chinese warship and a United States Navy guided-missile destroyer.\nThis underscored what the international community has long feared — an inadvertent drift into a conflict that neither side wants but may be unable to avert in a region bristling with heightened military activity. Thus, the renewal of high-level military contacts acquires importance in enabling the two countries to reduce the risk of a full-blown crisis or conflict.\n\nUS-China competition has also intensified in the area of technology. Washington is engaged in a battle to maintain supremacy with an intense ‘chip war’ underway.\nA year ago, it imposed sweeping measures to bar American companies and allied countries from exporting chips and advanced chip equipment to China to cripple its semiconductor industry, which manufactures chips and circuits for modern electronics ranging from supercomputers and smartphones to automobiles.\nDespite the fact that these sanctions proved to be counterproductive, last month the US tightened restrictions on exports of advanced computer chips to retard China’s efforts to develop artificial intelligence.\nThe US justified the new curbs as aimed at limiting China’s use of these for military purposes. Beijing slammed them as a violation of “the principles of fair competition” and designed to thwart its technological progress.\nGiven unresolved differences on these and other contentious issues in their strategic rivalry, the San Francisco summit represents a tentative melting of the ice between the two superpowers, but little more for now.\nIt suggests that in the months ahead, the focus of the relationship will be on crisis management. Nevertheless, the effort at de-escalation comes as a relief for the international community increasingly concerned about a confrontation that has far-reaching repercussions for the global economy and world stability."}]}

Strong headwinds unleashed by multiple crises and unmet challenges make the future outlook a troubled one. Adding to uncertainty is a record number of elections next year in countries across the world including the US.\nThe shift to a more multipolar world will gather increasing momentum but with multilateral institutions under persisting stress. Global power shifts will continue while middle powers will play a growing role in shaping geopolitics.\nUnpredictability will remain an overarching reality among key geopolitical trends, risks and challenges in 2024.The Economist’s ‘World Ahead 2024’ report predicts “multipolar disorder” due to conflicts and intensifying geopolitical rivalries. For sure, the number of cascading crises raging in the world today will keep it unstable and unsteady.\nControl Risks, the London-based risk consultancy firm, believes the coming year will witness “a high-water mark in crisis complexity and disruptiveness”, which could create a “risk management overload”. Others, including the World Economic Forum, point to the onset of the “age of polycrisis”.\nThe most significant strategic dynamic in the year ahead will be the course of relations between the US and China. Although both global powers see the danger of unmanaged confrontation and have sought in recent months to stabilise ties, their differences on issues ranging from Taiwan to trade and technology curbs — as well as their clash of geopolitical interests — will expose relations to continuing turbulence.\n\nWashington’s policy of containing China, reaffirmed in the Biden administration’s national security strategy, and assertive pushback by China, will keep relations on a tense track. Tech decoupling will accelerate, military competition will escalate and Taiwan will remain a dangerous flashpoint.\nControl Risks, however, sees relations entering a “holding pattern” as both countries deal with pressing domestic challenges — presidential elections in the US and economic problems in China. Conflict is ruled out in most assessments by international think tanks and investment advisory companies such as Black Rock. But countries across the world still worry about an accidental clash in the fraught Asia-Pacific region — the strategic theatre of the US-China stand-off.\nWhile challenges will be formidable in the year ahead, global leadership will be in short supply.\nEast-West tensions will intensify in 2024 with the war in Ukraine continuing but settling perhaps into a stalemate. Lack of serious efforts to find a negotiated end to the war means that a protracted conflict will continue to strain East-West relations, with obvious fallout on the global economy and supply chains.\nGlobal attention, however, has been diverted from Ukraine to Israel’s war on Gaza. The conflict has driven the Middle East into the vortex of violence and instability and what some Arab experts describe as a “generation-defining moment” for the Middle East.\nOn the back-burner for decades, the Palestinian issue has shot to the top of the international agenda. It also underlined that the US policy of normalising relations between Arab states and Israel by ignoring Palestine was deeply flawed and unsustainable, with the Abraham Accords strategy now upended by the war. 2024 will challenge and test the ability of Arab governments and major powers to establish lasting peace and security in the region by finding a just solution to the Palestinian issue and pressing Israel to return to a two-state solution.\n\nIn this polarised and fractured international landscape, middle powers will acquire more importance in influencing geopolitics in 2024. The US-China stand-off has offered opportunities and leeway to countries to increase their leverage by playing off that rivalry and pursuing an ‘independent’ path.\nMoreover, structural changes and dispersal of power in the international system — the very currency of power having changed — has created an enabling environment for middle power diplomatic activism and for them to wield influence. As these trends continue, they will create more space for middle powers to strengthen their bargaining power. This will oblige the two global superpowers to spend more diplomatic capital in engaging middle power countries.\nMost international risk assessments consider scores of elections due next year to have significant regional and international implications. Over four billion people are expected to cast their ballot in more than six dozen elections across the world.\nNone is more consequential than the US presidential election. If former president Donald Trump returns to power this would have far-reaching consequences for the world. As he will likely pursue the same unilateralist, disruptive foreign policy that characterised his past administration this will negatively impact relations with China, war in Ukraine, ties with alliance partners and US commitments on climate change among other areas.\n\nA key question in 2024 will be whether the trend witnessed in recent years of democratic regression will persist or come to a halt. Democratic backsliding has been pervasive as many democracies across the world face challenges from polarisation, intolerance, and toxic politics. They have also witnessed an erosion of civil liberties and media freedom and suppression of dissent. This is happening against a backdrop of economic stress and rising, unmet public expectations.\n\nThe global trend of democratic erosion has been recorded by many international organisations. For example, the latest edition of theGlobal State of Democracyreport by the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance found a record number of democracies in decline. It calculated that over two-thirds of the global population now live in backsliding democracies, authoritarian or hybrid regimes.\nHow to respond to the disruptive effects and new vulnerabilities created by advance technology — often dubbed as weapons of mass disruption — will continue to be a challenge in the coming year. A digitalised world faces vexing issues of cybersecurity as threats rise across the world.\nData theft and fraud, cyberattacks and breaches of critical systems, electricity networks and financial markets are all part of rising risks. Artificial intelligence, especially its military uses, also presents many dangers. Despite this there is no international effort aimed at managing or mitigating the destabilising effects of new technologies.\nChallenges there will be aplenty in 2024, but in a world where both global leadership and solidarity will be in short supply."}]}

This prompted the Election Commission of Pakistan to issue a ‘clarification’ rejecting reports about a delay in elections as “completely baseless and misleading”.\nIt said the electoral process is on track and the polls will be held as announced on Feb 8, 2024. The ECP is also expected to issue the election schedule this week. Yet public doubts continue. In a statement last week, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistanreferredto an “air of uncertainty” in the country created by “persistent rumours of potential delays”.\n\nSome political parties have accused their rivals of seeking to delay elections. One of them even called for a delay, citing thewinter weather, ignoring the fact that elections in the past have been held in February.\nSpeculation also intensified when reports emerged that ECP had not received funds the government had allocated to conduct the election and that it summoned the finance secretary for an explanation in this regard. The money was subsequently released.\nRemarks by Ghulam Ali, governor of KP, also added grist to the mill of those speculating about a postponement. The governor publicly voiced concerns about the security situation, saying this made it difficult to carry out political activities in parts of KP and Balochistan. True that a surge in terrorist attacks this year, especially by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, has led to a deterioration in the security situation in these two provinces. But that is not sufficient reason to postpone the polls. Both past experience and present realities dictate that the election should go ahead as scheduled.\nIn two previous elections, in 2008 and 2013, the security situation was much worse with the fallout from the raging war in Afghanistan posing an imposing challenge at the time. In fact, militant insurgency was at its peak in 2008 with two major terror attacks in KP just ahead of the election. Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s tragic assassination in December 2007 made the situation even more fraught.\nIt led to an outbreak of protests with several incidents of destruction of private and public property including ECP offices in interior Sindh. The election was postponed by little over a month — from Jan 8 to Feb 18. In 2013, the election was preceded by terrorist bombings by the TTP especially targeting the Awami National Party and involving an attack on a JUI-F rally in KP. But the election went ahead as scheduled.\nPeople want an elected government that can address the country’s challenges and fix the economy.\nIn any case if some parts of KP are vulnerable to terrorist violence, elections in ‘sensitive’ constituencies can be held later — as by-elections. The number would be very small and will not affect the overall outcome. The country’s two largest provinces, Punjab and Sindh, which account for over 72 million and 26m voters respectively (almost 100m out of a total electorate of 127m) face no security challenge. Nor does much of KP and Balochistan.\n\nTherefore, security cannot be invoked as justification for any poll delay. To do so on the basis of a handful of constituencies will be a pretext or alibi designed to serve other purposes and not a credible ground for delay.\nAny delay would have constitutional, political and economic implications. There are no constitutional grounds on which elections can be delayed. To postpone elections now would be an outright constitutional transgression. Politically, such a move could set the stage for turmoil in the country, deepen polarisation and become a source of political instability.\nAll three major political parties, which are now in electioneering mode, would oppose the delay and also mount a legal challenge plunging the country into a constitutional crisis. Half of the Senate is up for election in March. If elections are not held before then, it will leave the country with a truncated Upper House, which is elected by national and provincial assembly members. That too would be a recipe for constitutional chaos.\n\nThe economic cost to the country would also be high as uncertainty would gravely jeopardise the prospects for economic stability. The economy is still on life support, with the country having narrowly averted a debt default only months ago by securing aStand-by Arrangement(SBA) with the IMF. The bailout is only a temporary reprieve that momentarily restored some confidence.\nThe economy is still mired in a low-growth path where investment remains dampened, economic activity is subdued, and most longer-term decisions await elections and installation of a legitimate government. The fiscal situation has undoubtedly stabilised but the foreign exchange reserve position remains fragile with debt service payments eroding reserves over time.\nThe SBA ends in March. Given Pakistan’s external financing requirement of over $21 billion to meet its foreign debt obligations and finance the current account deficit in the next fiscal year, it would need to negotiate a larger, longer-term programme with the Fund (apart from having to secure more rollovers of loans from China). This would enable Pakistan to access financing from other multilateral development banks to credibly meet the country’s gross financing needs.\nOnly an elected government with a fresh mandate and authority to implement a new IMF programme can do this. This is also the expectation if not an implicit condition set by the IMF. Without a new Fund programme Pakistan would exhaust its foreign exchange reserves in June. Thus, postponing the election would risk economic chaos and leave the country teetering again on the brink of default.\nUncertainty will only raise the cost to the economy. It will continue to vitiate the investment climate, produce instability in the capital market and encourage capital flight. Already a caretaker arrangement that has exceeded the 90-day constitutionally mandated period in office has had to leave major economic decisions pending with obvious consequences for the country.\nOpinion surveys and anecdotal evidence show that people want elections as soon as possible so that a legitimate, elected government is in place to get on with the job of governance and start to purposefully address the country’s many challenges, especially fixing the economy to alleviate the public’s worsening economic plight."}]}

This followed on the heels of thevetoexercised by the US in the Security Council (SC) to block a similar ceasefire resolution.\nIt was the second time theUS vetoed a ceasefirethat could have brought an end to hostilities in Gaza and to Israel’s genocidal military campaign. In October, the US did the same, which was also followed by an extraordinary GA session requested by Arab and OIC countries.\n\nThen too, the GA voted by a decisive majority to demand a humanitarian truce. Both GA resolutions were a clear reflection of world opinion. They were also designed to mount diplomatic pressure on Washington to relent on its opposition to a ceasefire and blind support for Israel. But that didn’t happen.\nAs GA resolutions are non-binding and cannot override a veto, they could do nothing to stop the war. This meant Israel’s brutal bombardment continued to lay waste to Gaza and claim more lives.\nThe veto then has stood between war and peace. This has brought veto power into sharper public focus and reignited the debate about why the world’s premier body responsible for maintenance of international peace and security fails to fulfil its obligations when expected to act.\nThe veto enables the five permanent members of the Security Council who possess it to take unilateral actions to prevent resolutions they deem to be against their interests as well as protect their allies. This results in the Council’s paralysis. Failure to take action in times of war, crisis and mass atrocities denudes the Council of legitimacy and the UN too of credibility. The veto is arguably the UN Charter’s most anachronistic and controversial provision that makes the P5 unaccountable.\nThe Security Council’s paralysis denudes it of legitimacy and the UN of credibilit\nThe Security Council structure along with veto power were the product of the historical arrangement reached over 75 years ago by the victors of World War II. Veto power was bestowed on permanent members as a compromise to elicit agreement by the major powers on the establishment of the UN and their cooperation with it.\nOstensibly designed to ensure ‘peaceful relations’ between big powers it also aimed to insulate them from a decision against any of them. This was regarded by the wider membership as a ‘necessary price’ to pay for big powers’ support for the world body.\nThe P5’s privileged position was nonetheless questioned even at the UN’s inception but much more so in subsequent years as frustration grew with the Council’s ineffectiveness in the face of conflicts and international crises. Calls for reform also became louder with changing global realities as the Council was seen to reflect the power relations of a bygone era.\nThe first significant effort by the GA to respond to the Council’s paralysis came in 1950 with the adoption of the Uniting for Peace resolution (377), which provided that the GA could consider and make recommendations on a matter relating to the maintenance of peace and security if the Security Council failed to act. The two GA sessions on Gaza in October and December 2023 were convened by invoking this resolution.\n\nGrowing calls for SC reform led to the creation in 2009 of the intergovernmental negotiations process. Talks have been going on for over two decades in informal GA sessions with the aim of achieving comprehensive SC reform that addresses five interlinked issues, including categories of membership, question of veto and size of an expanded Council.\nThere is general agreement among countries on reform to reflect 21st-century realities and democratic principles to make the Council more representative and accountable. But consensus has been elusive on how to accomplish this — with no solution in sight. The question of the veto continues to be a source of intense contention.\nThe principal disagreement, mainly responsible for lack of progress in negotiations, is between countries that aspire for permanent seats for themselves and others who oppose this and propose enlarging the Council by adding more elected, non-permanent members. This has put the so-called G4 — Germany, Japan, India and Brazil — at odds with the Uniting for Consensus countries led by Italy and including Pakistan, Argentina, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Canada and other like-minded states.\nThe UFC argues that the Council’s frequent deadlock and paralysis is due to discord and clashing interests of the P5, which prevents it from playing the role expected of it and enjoined by the Charter. Adding more permanent members with veto powers will only compound this dysfunction, not end it. UFC members also regard the veto as contrary to the democratic principle of the sovereign equality of states.\n\nReform discussions on the veto have seen a confusing array of proposals ranging from adding more permanent members with veto, without veto; with deferred veto or committed to voluntary restraint; a veto exercised in a national capacity or on behalf of a region; an unconditional veto and one subject to periodic review.\nGiven the impasse in these negotiations some countries have meanwhile offered proposals to limit the use of veto in specific contexts. In 2013, France proposed voluntary restraint on the use of veto; a French-Mexican proposal urges voluntary suspension of the veto in situations of mass atrocities.\nA European proposal suggested restricting the veto in humanitarian cases. These have remained unimplemented proposals. An important move to make veto-holders accountable came last year with the GA’s adoption of a resolution, which requires the P5 to explain and justify their use of veto. This provides for the GA to be convened within 10 days after a veto to debate the situation. The first such debate was held in April this year.\nWhile these efforts are important, they have not dissuaded the two countries — US and Russia — who have used the veto most frequently over the decades from continuing to do so. The grave consequences of this are being witnessed today in the killing fields of Gaza, where peace has been vetoed."}]}

It saw much uncertainty in the country — about the economy and how its volatile politics will pan out. The question whether general elections would be held on time echoed through the year until the announcement at year end of a firm date and election schedule, with the Supreme Court acting as a ‘forcing’ factor. This put an end to uncertainty about the election date but not how, fair, free and inclusive the polls would be.\nThe first half of the year saw the ruling Pakistan Democratic Movement coalition engage incountering opposition leader Imran Khanand containing protests by his party in a politically charged atmosphere. An overarching aspect of these months of political tensions was the deepening polarisation in the country.\nPDM’s record in governance during its 16 months in power was unexceptional, inevitable perhaps for a diverse, unwieldy 13-party coalition. It became defined by its bloated cabinet — the largest in the country’s history.\nIts erratic economic management, with a change of finance minister early in its tenure, compounded the situation when the country was mired in the worst economic crisis in its history, although this was the cumulative result of decades of dysfunctional policies and political instability. 2023 also saw the country teeter precariously on the edge of debt default. This was narrowly averted by a bailout deal with the IMF in July and by the rollover of loans by China.\nTheStand-by Arrangement(SBA) with the Fund provided the economy a temporary reprieve for which the government was obliged to take a series of tough measures to stabilise the situation.Soaring inflationadded to the cost-of-living crisis and the public’s growing economic burden while the sudden and sharp rise in electricity bills fuelled widespread discontent and protests.\n\nIn August 2023, the PDM governmentstepped down, but in its final days secured approval from the Council of Common Interests for the new population census. It legally obliged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to first carry out a fresh delimitation of constituencies to reflect the census before elections could be called. This ruled out polls within the statutory 90-day period after dissolution of the National Assembly.\nIt gave the caretaker arrangement that was installed a longer tenure in power. This triggered intense uncertainty about when elections would be held while political moves and court dramas to secure earlier elections came to naught.\nPolitical volatility and economic fragility characterised 2023, raising questions about future stability.\nThe caretaker government assumed charge of the country in a hybrid governing arrangement in which the balance of power shifted even more significantly to the military to become a defining feature of governance in 2023. Major decisions in the interim phase were taken by the military establishment including on the economy, epitomised by the creation and management of the Special Investment Facilitation Council to promote “fast track” investment by friendly Arab countries.\nIt was also evidenced by the decision toexpel illegal foreign nationals, mostly Afghans from the country, and a much tougher policy towards Kabul, following a surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan by the outlawed group TTP, based in Afghanistan. However, the security situation continued to deteriorate throughout the year.\nThe most politically significant development of the outgoing year was the irrevocable breakdown of Imran Khan’s relations with his erstwhile backers in the military establishment. Whenviolent protests broke out on May 9over his (then temporary)arrest, PTI supporters attacked and vandalised military installations and government buildings. This and Khan’s persistent allegations that the military was behind a US-inspired plot to unseat him sealed his fate.\nIn August, he was arrested after his conviction by the Islamabad High Court in a corruption case that held him guilty of illegally selling state gifts. The conviction banned Khan from contesting elections and holding public office for five years. Over a hundred other cases were registered against him. A sweeping crackdown saw arrests of PTI leaders and activists while some were coerced into abandoning the party.\nBy the close of 2023, almost all itssenior leaders were in jailwhile the party’s efforts to hold public rallies were constantly disrupted by the authorities. This raised the question of how fair the poll would be with PTI claiming it was being “forced” out of the election process. Being deprived of its electoral symbol ‘bat’ by the ECP reinforced these doubts.\nA ‘new’ party waslaunchedby Jahangir Khan Tareen, former PTI stalwart, with official backing. The Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party, comprising mostly deserters from PTI, styled itself as an alternative, but the country’s history suggested that voters punished turncoats and fickle politicians. This, in fact, left the field open for PML-N, whose leader’s return from self-exile abroad gave an expected boost to the party. Nawaz Sharif’s political comeback was nothing short of remarkable.\nOver two decades ago, when he was exiled following a military coup, many believed his political career was over. But he came back to win the 2013 election and become prime minister for the third time.\nHaving returned now and able to secure favourable court verdicts in politically motivated cases in which he had been convicted, he quickly positioned himself for a fourth bid for prime ministership. He also got down to the business of politics, rallying his party, mending internal rifts and forging election alliances with other parties in anticipation of the possibility that the electoral outcome would necessitate a coalition government.\nBut more than politics it was the economy that emerged as the crucial factor to determine the country’s fate and fortunes in 2024 and the years ahead. A slew of negative trends continued through the year — internal and external financial imbalances remained wide, foreign exchange reserves depleted to a fragile level, inflation hit a historic high, domestic and foreign debt reached unsustainable levels, the rupee lost record value against the dollar, growth stagnated, exports fell, overseas remittances declined and foreign direct investment remained dampened.\nTrue, the SBA provided some fiscal stabilisation. But the consequential question for the year ahead was whether the election would produce a government committed to comprehensive reforms to address long-standing structural problems that could put the country on a path of sustained economic recovery and growth."}]}

The election date of Feb 8 is now cast in stone. But there are more unknowns than knowns about how the election will play out.\nThe first unknown is the PTI factor. Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf is engaged in legal actions aimed at securing a level playing field in the poll. It has contested thedecisionof the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to deprive it of its election symbol — which is how most voters identify which party a candidate belongs to on the ballot paper.\n\nCourt dramas are likely to continue on this and other counts, including petitions challenging Khan’s disqualification. Whatever the legal outcome, the key political question is whether the perception that PTI is being persecuted will translate into a ‘sympathy wave’ to boost its electoral support or deter its supporters from showing up at the ballot box.\nWith most of its leaders and many activists incarcerated, it will be hard for the party to mobilise its base. But the party has also shown a knack of using social media and communication technology to overcome such obstacles. Whether this will work in the complex environment of individual parliamentary constituencies remains to be tested.\nThis brings up the second unknown. Constitu­ency politics embedded in networks of traditio­nal allegiances often override the personal popularity of leaders at the national level. If there was a presidential system, a leader’s popularity would be enough to determine the outcome. But parliamentary elections are a different matter where dynamics are more complicated.\n\nThe phenomenon of ‘all politics is local’ also works to the advantage of older parties that have long dominated Pakistan’s constituency-based politics. Electoral politics still pivots around transactional patterns of behaviour and traditional allegiances to determine the result at the constituency level — hence the importance of so-called electables, who are local power brokers. This makes the overall outcome harder to predict.\nThe third unknown is the impact of the urban-rural balance, which in the past has long tilted in favour of the countryside and reinforced traditional allegiances. But greater urbanisation is altering this picture. Although urban Pakistan is still underrepresented, many rural constituencies now have urban features.\nIn the battleground province of Punjab, this shift is most evident. In Punjab’s 144 national constituencies more than half are now either urban or ‘mixed’, displaying a significant urban complexion. This is weakening older alignments and reshaping voting patterns, again making outcomes harder to forecast.\nPrevailing in the election will be in vain if the battle for Pakistan’s economic revival is lost.\nNew voters are a fourth unknown factor. Since the last election in 2018, over 23.5 million voters have been added to the electoral list — 18 per cent of the electorate. This could impart a significant swing factor to the election. A substantial number of new voters can be assumed to be unaffiliated to any party with no firm party preference. They are therefore up for grabs for any party able to appeal to them and get them out to vote.\n\nThe youth bulge in the electorate has, of course, attracted much attention. ECP figures show voters from the ages of 18 to 35 constitute 45pc of the electorate. This makes young voters a significant factor, even a game changer, in determining the poll outcome. But what is unknown is whether young voters will actually show up at the ballot box — which would give PTI an edge.\nSo far, turnout among younger voters has been exceedingly low. Official statistics are lacking on this but a Gallup-Pakistan report, relying on exit polls conducted since 1988, finds youth turnout to be much lower than overall voter participation. It shows that usually only a quarter of young voters turned out to vote. In the past two elections, their participation was only a third compared to the average overall turnout of 52pc.\nOverall voter turnout is itself a big unknown. It could be a significant indicator of how free, fair and credible voters will judge the election to be. Turnout in previous elections has ranged bet­w­­­een 51pc (2018), 53pc (2013), 44pc (2008) and 41pc (2002). The lowest turnout in 2002 was cle­a­­­­rly a measure of the scepticism with which people saw an election held under military rule. A very low turnout, say below 44pc, could undermine the legitimacy of the February election result.\n\nAnother unknown is how voters in Punjab will respond to the newIstehkam-i-Pakistan Partyorganised to upend PTI and comprised mostly of PTI deserters in a process orchestrated by the establishment. Pakistan’s electoral history shows voters usually punish turncoats, just as they reject expedient alliances. Individual IPP leaders with a strong constituency base may, however, buck this trend.\nWhat should be among election ‘knowns’ by now is where contesting parties stand on the consequential issues and challenges facing the country. But with elections just a month away, political parties have yet to articulate their positions on key policy issues or offer detailed programmes on what they will do if elected.\nOne party has made extravagant and utterly unrealistic promises wilfully ignoring the dire state of the economy. At a time when the economy is still in the critical ward and needs bold and decisive action, the need for policy ideas and options has never been greater. However, this has yet to figure in the election campaign that has so far been mostly about ticket distribution and ‘seat adjustment’ deals.\nPointing out that “Pakistan needs urgent fiscal and structural reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and lay the foundations for sustainable growth”, the lack of attention to economic issues and expressions of commitment to reform probably urged the World Bank to publiclyvoice concernabout post-election policy reversals in critical areas of reform by powerful vested interests. This, it said, could pose high macroeconomic risks to Pakistan, especially as the next government’s priorities and commitment to structural reforms are not known.\nWhile people wait to hear from their political leaders about how they plan to address pressing economic issues what is clear is that prevailing in the electoral contest will be in vain if the battle for Pakistan’s economic recovery and renewal is lost."}]}

But what will happen after the election will be far more consequential to the country’s future. Formidable challenges await the next government.\nThe governing ability of the election winner will be constrained by the complex dynamics of a volatile domestic environment. This is characterised by persisting polarisation, the most serious economic crisis in the country’s history, surge in security threats, declining capacity of state institutions, a fraught regional situation and a polity in which power has shifted more substantively to the military establishment.\n\nA slew of domestic and external challenges will test the government. These challenges will require the elected leadership to distinguish between the urgent and important while crafting a strategy to deal with both. Most consequential for the country’s future will be the government’s ability to deal with an economy in the critical ward.\nPakistan’s economic crises have all been rooted in governance deficits, with reform-averse ruling elites resorting to pain-free ways to deal with deep-seated problems. This band-aid approach that relied on borrowing at home and external financing or bailouts from abroad has run its course and is no longer tenable.\nUnless structural issues are tackled, the country will not be able escape from the trap of anaemic growth, high deficits, heavy borrowing, growing indebtedness and soaring inflation. The structural sources of persisting financial imbalances lie in a narrow and inequitable tax regime, limited export base, the energy sector’s circular debt, bankrupt public-sector enterprises, heavy regulatory burden and low savings and investment.\nWhat is needed is a comprehensive plan to address these structural issues and chart a path to sustainable growth that can end the vicious cycle of high budget/ balance-of-payments deficits and chronic foreign exchange crises, which have necessitated repeated IMF bailouts.\n\nThis in turn requires a bold and courageous leadership that leads a competent team, sees the significance of deep structural reforms and has the commitment to take measures, painful in the near term, but which yield enduring dividends in the long run.\nNone is more important than tax reform to make the regime equitable and simple. For decades the tax-to-GDP ratio has remained stuck at 10 per cent. Resource mobilisation, by widening the tax base, bringing untaxed sectors into the net, ensuring compliance, reforming GST and ending exemptions, is the single most important endeavour to address the chronic budget deficit and set the economy toward sustainability. A liberal and consistent business regulatory framework is also necessary to build and sustain investor confidence.\nBoth the urgent and important have to be tackled to extricate Pakistan from crisis.\nWhile dealing with the urgent — the immediate financial crisis — the important too has to be addressed, issues just as consequential to the country’s economic progress and future. This means investment in human capital. Failure to do so has already left the country with rising poverty, sharply deteriorating social indicators and at the bottom of global human development rankings — a situation the World Bank calls a “silent, deep human capital crisis.”\n\nUnde­rinvestment has meant around 40pc of Pakistanis are still illiterate, over 20 million school-age children are out of school, poverty has risen to almost 40pc and health indicators including malnutrition levels remain grim. Economic progress can only be predicated on a solid educational base.\nThis requires a long-term plan to widen the coverage and improve the quality of education. But it can no longer be postponed especially because of Pakistan’s demographic structure and youth bulge. Unless the scale and quality of education is expanded young people with no education or skills will face a jobless and hopeless future and a life of poverty.\nPopulation planning has rarely figured in any government’s priorities for many decades. Pakistan’s population of 242m makes it the world’s fifth most populous nation with the annual growth rate of 2.5pc among the highest in the region. This has far-reaching economic and social consequences.\nWith youth constituting 64pc of the population under 30, it means almost 4m young people join the working-age population every year. This in turn requires over a million new jobs to be created annually. The confluence of demographics, economic stagnation and persisting education and gender gaps acts as a significant obstacle to economic development and confronts Pakistan with the spectre of social instability.\n\nReform of the institutional machinery of state should also be among important issues on the next government’s agenda. The eroding capacity of the institutions of governance imposes obvious constraints on the exercise of power and ability to execute policies. Politicisation of the civil service has over the decades undermined merit and professionalism, corroded service morale, eroded its authority and sapped its capacity to efficiently deliver public services.\nPostponed reforms have further contributed to the decline in the quality of the civil service and weakened state capacity. As a result, the state’s basic functions to tax, maintain law and order and to educate have all been adversely affected.\nIt is also responsible for the long-term decline in public confidence in government institutions, as reflected in successive opinion surveys. Institutional strengthening and civil service reform must therefore be an integral part of the government’s agenda of turning the economy around, ensuring effective policy implementation and improving overall governance.\nFocusing on these pivotal issues will require the government to avoid getting entangled in confrontational politics against its opponents.\nThat means a conscious effort to break from an unedifying past which has seen endless government-opposition confrontations and distracted from the job of governance.\nIn fact, to establish a stable and predictable environment the government should aim to work democracy in a consensual way by the display of tolerance and accommodation of views other than its own. The federal nature of the polity makes this imperative especially as the electoral outcome may leave some provinces in the hands of political parties different from the one controlling the centre.\nIn any case democracy cannot be limited to the ballot box. It should determine how the country is governed between elections."}]}

Pakistan’s repeated public warnings to the Taliban about the consequences of TTP’s cross-border attacks seemed to have little effect.\nWhen the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, Islamabad hoped this would help Pakistan secure its western border. But this expectation was not met. Instead, there was a marked escalation in border tensions and terrorist attacks targeting Pakistan’s security forces. Successive reports by the UN Security Council’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team found the “TTP benefitted the most of all the foreign extremist groups in Afghanistan from the Taliban takeover”.\nPakistan’s own assessment, contained in a leaked defence ministry report last May, was similar. The report said that Kabul’s unwillingness to act against the TTP and its regrouping in Afghanistan after the Taliban’s assumption of power posed a growing threat to Pakistan’s security.\nMeanwhilestatementsby the military voiced serious concerns about “the safe havens and liberty of action available to the TTP in Afghan­istan”. In July, Army Chief General Asim Munir warned of an “effective response” by the country’s security forces if attacks continued from Afghanistan. Other Pakistani officials asked Kabul to choose between the TTP and Pakistan.\n\nThe surge in terrorist activities in 2023 led to a significant rise in the casualties of security personnel, which hit an eight-year high. This left Islamabad increasingly frustrated. Attacks by TTP became more audacious after the collapse of its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The short-lived ceasefire was itself a misguided and futile attempt by the Pakistani authorities to end the armed group’s 14-year war on Pakistan.\nA wave of violence followed. In one of the worst incidents of terrorism, the TTP attacked a mosque in Peshawar’s police lines in January 2023, which claimed nearly a hundred lives and shook the country. Then too dire warnings were issued by Pakistani officials to the Taliban authorities. But to little avail.\nSeveral rounds of talks and multiple interactions with Taliban officials last year produced no outcome. In these talks Taliban leaders offered assurances about restraining the TTP but asked for time to accomplish this. They also argued that containing TTP was a question of their capacity and not commitment. But Islamabad’s patience was beginning to wear thin.\nThe core issue at the heart of tensions between the two countries is still unresolved.\nA high-level delegation wasdispatchedto Kabul in February 2023 to convey Pakistan’s red line on terror attacks from Afghan soil and secure a firm commitment from Kabul to rein in TTP and deny it the sanctuary its fighters enjoy there. In these parleys Taliban leaders apparently asked for financial help, ostensibly to disarm and resettle TTP fighters, estimated to be around 5,000, away from the border with Pakistan.\nAll this amounted to nothing especially as this was accompanied by Taliban leaders’ ‘advice’ that Pakistan should revive negotiations with the TTP. This in fact proved to be a turning point urging Islamabad to rethink its Afghan policy.\nAgainst this backdrop Pakistani authorities began to shift course and adopted a tougher policy towards Kabul. Any talks with TTP were firmly rejected. A number of actions followed, designed to mount pressure on the Taliban leadership and raise the costs of its non-cooperation on TTP.\nThey included the decision to deport tens of thousands of undocumented Afghans from the country and substantial change in regulations governing transit trade by imposition of a ban on many import items from Pakistan (which led to thousands of stranded containers that were prevented from going to Afghanistan.) Islamabad also intensified public criticism of Kabul, accusing it of harbouring Pakistan’s enemies. All this showed that Islamabad was prepared to deploy several levers to pressure the Taliban.\nIn response, Kabul indicated its keenness to mend ties with Islamabad while urging it to decouple trade from terrorism and desist from forcing it to take actions under pressure. The recent visit of an Afghan delegation to Pakistan marked an effort to reengage on issues of priority for both sides at a time when a regular meeting of the joint coordination committee was also due.\nLed by Kandahar Governor Mullah Sherin Akhund, reputed to be a close confidante of Taliban supreme leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, the delegation was deemed as a serious effort to defuse tensions. The Afghan delegation’s ‘asks’ included the release of containers among other trade issues and a slowing down of the repatriation process for the winter months. The Pakistani side made it clear that movement on the core issue of TTP was essential to address other issues and that patience on that count had already run out.\n\nFrom accounts of the exchanges on TTP it did not appear any progress was made on this issue. As in the past, the Afghan side asked for more time to deal with TTP citing winter as an impediment this time. It also said it would shift TTP members away from the border but that too would start some months from now.\nIn playing for time and not setting out any plan of action to deal with TTP, this again raised the question of the Taliban’s seriousness. That Mullah Sherin offered to take Pakistan’s message back to the Taliban chief was about the only outcome from the parleys on TTP. Pakistani officials see this as a test in coming months of the top Taliban leadership’s intentions. They say the jury is out on whether it will change course and address the issue. But then the jury has been out for quite some time.\nThe key question is what are Pakistan’s options if the Taliban show continued unwillingness to act against the TTP. There are no easy answers as there are limits to the leverage Pakistan can use in a coercive approach without risking a rupture in relations, which it would want to avoid."}]}

Relations between the two neighbours have been uneasy even at the best of times. The presence of armed groups on both sides of the border has long been a sticking point.\nBut theIranian air strikeagainst a militant group inside Pakistani territory sparked unprecedented tensions and evoked a strong response from Islamabad. A Foreign Office statement condemned the “unprovoked violation of its airspace” and warned of “serious consequences.” Iran’s action drove relations to a historic low, compelling Islamabad toretaliateby conducting military strikes against militant targets in Iran.\n\nThis flare-up in tensions could not have come at a worse time, when Islamabad’s relations with its other two neighbours remain deeply troubled. Pakistan’s regional security concerns have shown little sign of easing in recent years. Relations with India remain frozen, with frequent eruption of tensions along the Line of Control in Kashmir.\nPakistan’s ties with Afghanistan under the Taliban have become increasingly fraught and testy. Having long sought to prevent a two-front scenario of hot borders with its neighbours, Islamabad now has to deal with this very security challenge. Despite the de-escalation in Iran-Pakistan tensions, the relationship has been damaged.\nThe next government will have its hands full on the foreign policy front, apart from dealing with multiple domestic challenges, especially the ongoing economic crisis. The range of foreign policy issues it will have to address makes it necessary to undertake a wide-ranging review of the entire gamut of foreign policy. Holding envoys conferences is not the same thing.\nWith global power shifts underway in an unsettled, multipolar world, characterised by mounting geopolitical tensions and a fraying international order, there is urgent need for the managers of Pakistan’s foreign policy to assess this big picture and take stock. Without a broad review and understanding of linkages between various policy areas, Islamabad will be unable to effectively navigate the complex international and regional geopolitical terrain.\n\nAt the global level, the key challenge would be to avoid getting into the crosshairs of US-China confrontation, the overarching global dynamic today. Much rhetoric is heard from Pakistani officials about balancing relations between two global powers. That’s declaratory policy.\nThe reality is that China is Pakistan’s overriding priority, with a solid economic dimension now augmenting long-standing strategic ties. Having stood the test of time, the relationship meets both Pakistan’s security and economic interests. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is the pivot of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, whose timely progress requires close coordination and addressing Beijing’s security concerns in this regard.\nThe next government faces an array of imposing foreign policy issues.\nWith the US, relations have been in flux since the American military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. This diminished Pakistan’s importance in Washington’s eyes, because, for two decades, Afghanistan was the principal basis for the relationship, which was largely shorn of bilateral content and marked by both close cooperation and deep mistrust.\nThe challenge for the next government is to find a new basis for ties, forge a stable relationship with Washington, and be prepared to deal with a possible Trump presidency. The US remains Pakistan’s largest export destination, a source of FDI and a global power with significant influence, especially over international financial institutions, whose assistance Pakistan’s crisis-prone economy constantly needs.\nComplicating a reset in ties is Washington’s top strategic priority of containing China. As Pakistan cannot be part of any anti-China coalition, this limits the space for Pakistan-US relations. As does Washington’s growing strategic and economic relationship with India, its partner of choice in the region in its strategy to project India as a counterweight to China.\n\nThe implications for Pakistan of the US-India partnership are apparent from Washington turning a blind eye to Delhi’s illegal actions in occupied Kashmir and its augmentation of India’s military capabilities. The latter has aggravated the regional strategic imbalance and magnified Pakistan’s security dilemma. The challenge, then, is to find space between the Pakistan-China strategic relationship and US-India entente to rebuild ties for mutual benefit. There are certainly areas of cooperation to explore to reconfigure ties.\nManaging the troubled relationship with India will arguably be the most vexing foreign policy challenge. Relations were ruptured when India illegally annexed Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019, and absorbed it into the Indian Union in brazen violation of UN Security Council resolutions. Formal dialogue was suspended by Delhi even earlier, and trade, too, was halted.\nNew irritants emerged, including disagreement over the Indus Waters Treaty dispute settlement mechanism. Against this backdrop, the question is whether a fresh start is still possible if Nawaz Sharif returns to power and Narendra Modi is re-elected, given their past relationship which produced a thaw in ties.\nThe path to normalisation of relations, however, remains strewn with formidable challenges given Delhi’s actions in occupied Kashmir and refusal to even talk to Islamabad about the dispute. It would be difficult for Pakistan to take steps to normalise ties if Delhi rules out discussion of the issue and claims all it will talk about is for Pakistan to vacate Azad Kashmir.\nAs normalisation may not be a near-term possibility, Islamabad and Delhi should focus on managing tensions and consider how to put in place an agreed framework to manage tensions in order to prevent them spinning out of control.\n\nDealing with Afghanistan will also preoccupy the next government at a time when relations have hit a new low because of the Taliban’s unwillingness to act against the terrorist group, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, which continues to carry out cross-border attacks from its Afghan sanctuaries.\nEndless rounds of talks between the two neighbours have yielded little, forcing Islamabad to adopt a tougher stance towards Kabul. There are, however, limits to a coercive approach, as Pakistan would not want a breakdown in relations. This leaves it with a difficult policy dilemma in dealing with Kabul.\nThere are other foreign policy challenges too, which the government will have to deal with. But it is Pakistan’s domestic trajectory — how competently it governs itself and builds a strong economy — that will determine the effectiveness of its foreign policy. All foreign policy, after all, begins at home."}]}

Or is it more of the same? There are several significant similarities with past polls. The same parties are contesting — some reincarnations of older ones while others cobbled together by defectors from another party.\nThey are led by the same political figures. Many contestants running as independents are familiar names. The establishment’s ubiquitous role is no different from the past. Its interventions to limit the electoral chances of one political party mimics the past; this time it is PTI; in the last election it was PML-N. The issueless character of the election campaign is also not new.\n\nBut there are also several departures from the past which have been obscured in much of the commentary about the elections. For a start, the polls are taking place against the backdrop of the most serious economic crisis the country has ever faced. This itself is distinct from the past as it has involved far-reaching repercussions for people, in the form of a cost-of-living crisis, rising unemployment and increased poverty.\nThis has come on the back of continuing power shortages across the country with gas ‘load-shedding’ being even more frequent this winter season. These are all drivers of public discontent. It is yet to be seen how this will manifest itself at the ballot box and who voters will attribute their economic plight to.\nA second difference is the intensely polarised atmosphere in which the election is taking place. Polarised politics is of course not new. But the extent of polarisation today is unprecedented, dividing people and society along intensely partisan lines. There is much less tolerance than in the past for political opponents, while a toxic quality has been injected into the political conversation and debased what passes for debate.\n\nThree, and perhaps the most visible break from the past, is the subdued nature of the election campaign that is in progress. This is somewhat paradoxical, given the deep polarisation in the country. But it is partially explained by the restrictions placed on one of the parties. Missing is the festive atmosphere and public fervour that usually characterises the run-up to elections.\nThis is also reflected in one of the findings of the most current public opinion survey conducted by Gallup & Gilani Pakistan this month, in which 44 per cent of Pakistanis said they had not seen any banners, flags or posters of political parties in their neighbourhoods and localities. The survey also found that only one in five Pakistanis said they have been canvassed by party candidates, members or activists in door-to-door efforts to seek votes for their party.\nThe media too has been commenting that this is the most lacklustre election campaign in the country’s recent history. The fact that it is mostly devoid of policy issues however marks a continuity with the past. Two of the three major parties announced their manifestos less than two weeks before the election giving little time for meaningful debate on their respective programmes.\nSeveral factors inject unpredictability into the electoral outcome.\nFour, the greater role of social media in this election is arguably the most important distinction from the past. Its impact will be tested on polling day but for now it is being deployed by all major political parties with PTI’s digital media team being ahead of the game.\n\nIn fact, the undeclared curbs placed on the party, and being deprived of its election symbol by the Election Commission of Pakistan, forced it to resort even more to social media tools — X, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube — as well as AI-driven chatbot to reach supporters and the public at large. The party has also used AI-generated speeches and an article inThe Economistby Imran Khan. It has sought to hold virtual ‘rallies’ and fundraisers via online platforms.\nIn response to these digital efforts, the authorities began to shut down social media from time to time and orchestratedinternet ‘outages’that they ascribed totechnical reasons. Whether social media electioneering will make a significant difference to voting behaviour — and turnout — will be clear on polling day, but its greater use is certainly a ‘first’.\n\nThe fifth difference from past elections is the record number of independents contesting the election both for national and provincial assemblies — the highest in Pakistan’s electoral history. The number of independents in the contest for 266 general NA seats is 3,205. That’s over 60pc of candidates vying for seats in the Lower House.\nFor the provincial assemblies 8,341 independent aspirants are in the run, which is twice the number of candidates fielded by political parties. These figures include PTI-affiliated candidates as they are unable to contest as party candidates by the loss of their election symbol; there being no PTI name or symbol on the ballot paper.\nThis could be consequential for government formation later especially as no party is expected to win an overall majority and will need allies for a coalition government. Independent candidates can join another party without any legal constraint and of course be enlisted to be part of a coalition arrangement.\n\nThe higher number ofyoung votersis another distinguishing factor. The youth bulge among voters obviously reflects the youthful structure of the country’s population. Young voters have increased to almost 57 million now from 46.43m 2018. That’s over 44pc of the electorate.\nIf they come out in large numbers to vote they could be a game changer in shaping the outcome, especially if they have a strong preference for a particular party. Being tech-savvy, younger voters are also more likely to be influenced by narratives of the political party that is adept at using social media tools.\nWhen taken together, all these factors inject a degree of uncertainty and unpredictability into the electoral outcome. This despite the conventional wisdom that the result can easily be forecast and is in fact already known."}]}

In the country’s 12th general election a record number of 128.5 million voters will decide who forms the next government.\nPunjab, of course, has more voters — 73.2m — than those in the other three provinces put together, which makes it the battleground province that will determine the outcome of the national election.\nThere are 5,113 candidates in the contest for 266 general seats of the 342-member Lower House in the country’s first-past-the-post system. A total number of 12,638 candidates are in the run for assembly seats in the four provinces. There are 313 female contenders for National Assembly seats, the highest ever, but still only 6pc of the total, while 568 female candidates are in the race for provincial assembly seats.\nWhat are the key pointers to watch out for on election day?\nVoter turnout:How many people show up at the ballot box will reflect the level of political engagement as well as the health and vitality of Pakistan’s democracy. It will also be a significant indicator of how credible and inclusive the electorate sees the polls, especially in view of widespread public doubts about their fairness.\n\nThe average turnout in the last two general elections was around 52pc. In the past four elections it ranged between 51pc (2018), 53pc (2013), 44pc (2008) and 41pc (2002). In the 1990s, which saw four elections in quick succession starting with the one in 1988, turnout averaged 42pc, except in 1997 when it fell to 36pc. In general, turnout usually dropped when people felt their vote would make no difference to the outcome or that the election was ‘pre-determined’. This time if turnout is very low it could indicate a lack of confidence in the election’s integrity and thus undermine the legitimacy of the result.\nThere will be many indicators on election day of what the outcome might be.\nYoung voters:The youth bulge among registered voters is now a prominent feature of the electoral landscape. The number of young voters (between ages 18 and 35) today is at a record high — 57m, which is over 47pc of the electorate. This is a potential game-changer.\n\nThe heavy presence of young people in queues at polling stations might provide an early indication of how well parties with a youth following will do. In past elections, turnout among younger voters has been low. There are no official statistics on this. But a Gallup Pakistan report, relying on exit polls conducted since 1988, found that usually only a quarter of young voters cast the ballot.\nIn the past two elections, their participation was a third compared to the average overall turnout of 52pc. But according to the latest youth survey by theVoice of America, 70pc of respondents said they will vote on Feb 8.\nAnecdotal evidence also suggests young people are now more motivated to vote. If they do show up in large numbers, it could produce upsets and defy conventional wisdom about the invincibility of ‘electables’ or locally influential candidates.\n\nNew voters:Over 23.5m new voters have been added to the electoral rolls since the 2018 election, including over 12m female voters. Thus, new voters constitute 18pc of the electorate. They mostly comprise young voters but possibly also older voters not registered before. This could impart a significant swing factor to the election because many of them may be unaffiliated to any party and open to last-minute canvassing by candidates. This could make the outcome unpredictable in several constituencies.\nWomen’s participation:59.3m registered female voterscomprise46.1pc of the electorate even though they account for 49pc of the population. Male voters are 69.2m or 54pc of the electorate. That means there are around 10m more male than female voters, which lays bare the electorate’s persisting gender gap.\nNevertheless, this gap has been steadily narrowing thanks to initiatives by the Election Commission of Pakistan and advocacy groups to increase women’s participation. On voter turnout the gender gap persists. In the 2018 election turnout among women trailed by 10pc from that of men. Male turnout was almost56pc for the NA election, but just over 46pc for female voters.\n\nIt would be worth watching whether women’s polling stations on Feb 8 will see longer lines to indicate greater participation which could benefit parties with a stronger female base of support.\nMarginal seats:A critical area to watch would be the marginal constituencies. There is a sizeable number of tightly fought seats in Pakistan’s first-past-the-post system. Well over 100 NA seats were won by a plurality, not majority of votes in the 2018 election. Eighty-seven NA seats were won by a margin of less than 1,000 votes, and 26 seats by a margin of under 2,000 votes. In 51 constituencies, the winning candidate’s margin of victory was under 6,000 votes.\n\nMost of these were in Punjab — where general elections are won or lost. With the average size of Punjab’s national constituencies around 900,000 today, these are fragile margins of victory. The overall election result could be determined by what happens in these marginal constituencies, where there may be four-cornered fights between PML-N, PTI-backed candidates, PPP and IPP.\nSensitive polling stations:Half of the 90,675 polling stations across the country have been designated as ‘sensitive’ or ‘most sensitive’ by the ECP. Sensitive means there is a security risk; ‘most sensitive’ denotes a higher risk. Around 27,628 are classified as sensitive and 18,437 as most sensitive, the majority of which are in Punjab followed by Sindh, KP and Balochistan.\n\nThat means these polling stations are vulnerable to election violence involving clashes among supporters or attacks by militant groups — the latter principally in KP and Balochistan. Although extra security arrangements are in place for them, they should be closely watched on election day for violence that could disrupt the process.\nOf course, the most important aspect of election day would be any instances and evidence of efforts to manipulate the poll result or ballot fraud. That would undermine the democratic exercise, denude the electoral outcome of legitimacy and plunge Pakistan into another period of instability."}]}

This was a pivotal poll in the backdrop of the political tensions and uncertainty of recent years, which left the country in a polarised and unstable state.\nAlacklustre campaigndidn’t discourage people from showing up at the ballot box in greater numbers than predicted. This was testimony to their stake in the democratic process, indicating they felt their vote mattered. The turnout defied thenarrativethat the election outcome was a forgone conclusion. When results were in, it became clear that this narrative had overlooked electoral dynamics and public sentiment on the ground.\n\nThe Election Commission of Pakistan did not cover itself in glory by itsinexplicable tardinessin announcing election results. Despite its claim that it had set up an improved system to announce results, the inordinate delay evoked sharp criticism and allegations of foul play. Internet andmobile network disruptionsadded to the controversy and earned both ECP and the caretaker government justified criticism. PTI leaders claimed “winning seats had been turned into defeats”. Several Western states urged investigation into poll irregularities.\nVoters delivered a divided mandate and hung parliament. Results from 265 national constituencies showed PTI-backed candidates winning the most seats, followed by PML-N and then PPP. PTI candidatesswept KPand made astrong showingin Punjab.\nPML-N’s wins were mostly in Punjab, while the PPP held on to its traditional stronghold of Sindh, also securing seats in Balochistan. PTI’s performance in the face of curbs, denial of its election symbol and with all its top leaders in jail showed that a sympathy wave and determined voting by supporters carried its candidates across the finish line.\n\nBoth PML-N and PTI leaders declared victory and claimed they were the single, largest party or bloc in the National Assembly. But neither won a simple majority which left no party in a position to form a government on its own. This makes government formation an imposing task, which will involve tough and protracted bargaining and political horse-trading. This, of course, is not new. Pakistan has long had coalition governments, and that era is far from coming to a close.\nPakistan has voted for democracy but healing and reconciliation are needed for stability.\nThe question is how long government formation can take even if PML-N, with the pre-election alliances it forged with smaller parties, is in the best position to do so. The poor performance of Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party and JUI-F adds to its difficulties. On the other hand, PTI-backed candidates face the challenge of remaining a cohesive group as efforts will be made for them to switch sides and join a PML-N-led coalition.\nPPP had said earlier it will reach out to independents but the numbers do not suggest it can cobble a coalition together. For a PML-N-PPP coalition to emerge, which Nawaz Sharif is now working for, the hostility between the two parties has to be overcome. In aconciliatory speech, Sharif has also indicated willingness to reach out to ‘independents’.\n\nHow the 70 reserved seats are allocated will play a key part. They are supposed to be distributed in proportion to the total general seats won by parties. Not being recognised as a political party will deprive PTI of any of these and create an anomalous situation where reserved women and minority seats will simply be distributed among other parties, augmenting their numbers ‘artificially’.\nWhoever is able to form the government will face several daunting challenges. The most important is dealing with an economy that is still in the critical ward. Soaring inflation has fuelled a cost-of-living crisis, which has played into the election, with PML-N’s inability to secure a majority partly attributable to the burden of incumbency given its record in the PDM government it led until last August. The next government will have to expeditiously negotiate a fresh, extended programme with the IMF as the stand-by arrangement will end in March. This is urgently needed for Pakistan to meet its heavy foreign debt liabilities in the years ahead.\nBut a weak coalition government will dampen the prospects of wide-ranging economic reforms that Pakistan desperately needs to put it on the trajectory of sustainable growth and investment. If the next government is a minority one, dependent for survival on appeasing a motley group of parties, will it be able to take tough and politically painful decisions to extricate the country from the economic crisis?\n\nThe fall in share prices on the stock market and weakening in Pakistan’s sovereign dollar bonds in the wake of the election reflected uncertainty about the prospects of political stability and meaningful economic reform.\nThe political challenge will be no less demanding. Whoever forms the government will face a numerically strong opposition in the National Assembly. That will make legislative work an onerous task apart from having to deal with what is expected to be a noisy parliament. Moreover, with the country so divided and polarisation reinforced by the election, this too has implications for the incoming government.\nThe regionalised nature of the election result in the provincial assemblies will be another challenge for the government at the centre. With the PPP running the Sindh government, PTI controlling KP, PML-N forming the Punjab government, the federal government will face the test of managing the country when three of the four provinces are governed by different political parties, at loggerheads with each other.\nThe next government will also have to deal with the challenge of establishing smooth and stable relations with the military which in recent years has acquired a much larger role in politics and governance, even in economic and investment matters. The state of civil-military relations could be a key factor that determines the longevity of the coalition arrangement.\nAn election that people hoped would deliver political stability has ended up creating a host of uncertainties and issues of legitimacy. The country is in dire need of stability that can only be established by a process of reconciliation and healing. Voters see democracy as the best path to achieve stability. But the question is whether the country’s leaders can live up to the challenge of working democracy in the public interest and not just their own. n"}]}

Protests against ballot fraud continue to take place across the country andvirtually paralysed Balochistan. The claims about riggingmade by the commissionerof Rawalpindi will have to be fully investigated, as they have raised further questions about the credibility of elections.\n\nA hung parliament sent the major parties scurrying to cobble a majority. Imran Khan’s PTI, which won the biggest share of seats to emerge as the single largest bloc in the National Assembly, wasn’t accepted as the winner by the other two major parties.\nInstead, they joined hands to announce that PML-N would form a coalition government headed by Shehbaz Sharif, comprising a motley group of six parties. Initially, PTI pressed its right to form the government andnamedOmar Ayub as its prime ministerial candidate. But without enough allies, it knew it would not be able to secure the requisite number for a majority. It then announced it would sit as the opposition in the National Assembly.\nIf all this added up to a confusing picture, there was more to come. To cross the magic number of 134 NA seats in order to stake an initial claim to form the government, PML-N needed the PPP’s backing. It secured this — taking it well over the needed number — but with caveats.\n\nThe PPP decided not to join the coalition government or cabinet butdeclaredit would support PML-N in forming the government and electing the prime minister. This indicated PPP leaders preferred to keep a distance from a government that everyone anticipates would be weak and compelled to take tough and politically unpopular decisions on the ailing economy.\nIt means the PML-N-led coalition will be a precariously poised, unstable minority government. As one PML-N leader candidly put it, the PPP could pull the rug from under the coalition government’s feet any time that suited it. This is why several League members advised their leaders to focus on Punjab and not go for a government at the centre.\nTo be sure, the PML-N-led government will be ever more dependent on the PPP for its survival and will need to constantly keep it happy, especially as their differences have only been papered over. PPP seeks the president’s post for Asif Zardari, and wants other top constitutional posts while avoiding the responsibility of being part of government. It also wants a share in the Punjab government.\nNo one wins if political turmoil continues when the need is to take the economy out of the critical ward.\nOf course, the process of government formation has yet to formally begin. The Assembly has to meet, reserved seats have to be allocated according to the proportion of seats won by the parties, and then the election of speaker has to take place. All this is likely to be an acrimonious and contentious process.\nPTI is reported to be considering asking its candidates tojoin the Majlis-i-Wahdatul Muslimeen, a religious party, to enable it to claim reserved seats for women and minorities, which it would otherwise not be entitled to as it lost its status as a political party by a ruling of the Election Commission of Pakistan. PTI is also waging a legal battle in the courts, challenging election results in many constituencies.\n\nEven if a PML-N-led coalition government is formed at the federal level without any hitches, the question is how stable will it be. Already, the intense bargaining between coalition partners over cabinet and other top posts, including the presidency, indicates that a patchwork political arrangement is likely to emerge in which political rivals forced into a marriage of convenience will have to work together. This will not be easy.\nThe most consequential test of such an arrangement will be on economic management. One of the immediate priorities for the government will be to negotiate a new, larger programme with the IMF given Pakistan’s heavy debt service obligations ahead and the Stand-by Arrangement ending in April. This will require commitments by the government to implement tough economic measures. Will the prime minister be able to secure the support of his allies for steps likely to add to the cost-of-living crisis in the near term?\nThe choice of finance minister will also be critical to build credibility with the Fund and other multilateral financial institutions.\n\nIt would be a mistake to see the coalition patched together by PML-N as a replay of the previous PDM arrangement. That coalition government included the PPP and, because PTI had walked out of the NA, there was no parliamentary opposition to deal with. This is not the case today.\nMoreover, Shehbaz Sharif will also have to rely on ‘borrowed’ authority from Nawaz Sharif, who has opted to stay out of government, but will be calling the shots from behind the scenes. Shehbaz will have to contend with the dynamics of a parallel power centre in Punjab, with Maryam Nawaz as its chief minister. She will also be charged with rebuilding the party given the erosion in its support base in its erstwhile provincial stronghold.\nIf the centre will present challenges for the government, the state of play in the provinces is even more daunting. The federal government will have a complex provincial landscape to navigate. The four provinces will all be run by different political parties as a consequence of the regionalised electoral outcome.\n\nThe government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will be controlled by PTI. That Khan chose a combative hawk, Ali Amin Gandapur, as chief minister of the provincial government indicates a confrontational approach. How effectively Shehbaz Sharif is able to manage centre-province relations, including with the PPP-governed provinces of Sindh and Balochistan, in the face of economic difficulties and scarce resources is a key question.\nAll this means the prospects for political stability are rather dim. Tensions remain high and uncertainty is set to continue with no sign of even a temporary truce between feuding political parties. Nor is the controversy over a disputed election likely to end anytime soon.\nAlready questions are being raised about how long a tenuous coalition government can last despite the establishment’s support. The greatest risk posed by more political turmoil is that it can send a fragile economy into meltdown, with far-reaching consequences for the country’s future."}]}

This is aimed at setting a policy direction for the government and setting out its priorities. But when there is no effort to formulate an agreed programme of action the impression conveyed is that the alliance is all about power but bereft of public purpose.\nThePML-N-PPP joint presserseemed to signal that the priority was to carve up top public offices between them, which raised the question of whether they had an aim other than wielding power and securing access to government posts.\nAlready an election campaign even more issue-less than in the past provided no clue to how the various aspirants for power would tackle Pakistan’s multiple challenges. No credible plan was offered to voters about how they proposed to solve the country’s problems. People looked in vain for clearly enunciated, implementable ideas to deal with an ailing economy.\n\nPolitical parties issued perfunctory manifestos on the eve of the election but these barely figured in their campaigning. The manifestos themselves were long on platitudes and extravagant promises but short on substance. This made political parties almost indistinguishable in terms of their stance on issues of public concern.\nIn what passed for debate on television during the campaign, the accent was on criticising political opponents, not how national problems should be solved. In public rallies too political leaders were preoccupied more with vilifying each other than articulating their stance on public issues.\nThe electronic media made little effort to direct the political conversation to policy issues or question party representatives on what purpose they would bring to governance. This let political leaders off the hook as they faced little scrutiny on this score. Also ignored were proposals by think tanks and other organisations which laid out policy recommendations for political leaders to consider. These never became part of the political discourse or attracted much TV coverage during the campaign.\nThis only reinforced a trend in recent years of politics being focused more on power struggles than public policy. Lost in the noise of confrontational politics has been serious consideration of issues critical to the country’s political and economic future. The past few years have also seen the tone and content of political discourse plunge to a low not witnessed before.\nIn a polarised environment, political narratives have mostly been reduced to deriding rivals. Instead of reasoned debate on issues of national importance, much of the political conversation has consisted of toxic rhetoric and allegations of malfeasance and venality by political leaders against one another.\nHave parties that will form the government done any policy thinking on solving the country’s problems?\nNot surprisingly, this conduct and language was also evidenced in the election campaign. Political parties fell short of offering a credible vision for the country’s future or any strategy to reach that destination. This at a time when the country confronts unprecedented challenges crying out for answers — the most serious economic crisis in the country’s history, crippling power shortages, surge in security threats, declining capacity of state institutions, deterioration in public service delivery, a fraught regional situation and a polity in which power has shifted much more to the military establishment.\n\nAn imposing array of problems await the next government. Obviously, the economy is the number one issue that needs to be urgently addressed. But this requires an environment of calm, which means bringing an end to the present political tensions and turmoil.\nThe aftermath of a disputed election will not be easy to handle. Much will depend on how seriously the government ensures complaints of ballot fraud are fully investigated so that the election’s credibility is not left in any doubt. This in turn needs an approach that breaks decisively from the past and is predicated on engaging rather than isolating or suppressing the opposition.\nWithout establishing the conditions for domestic peace and stability, efforts to meet the economic challenge will not succeed. Many political parties have spoken of the need for an extended, larger IMF programme, notwithstanding PTI leaders’ contradictory statements about a Fund loan.\nOnce the federal government is installed, it isexpectedto negotiate a new loan package with the IMF. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for economic recovery. A home-grown economic plan will have to be crafted that entails wide-ranging reforms to tackle the structural roots of Pakistan’s perennial financial crisis and need for bailouts.\nThe structural sources of persisting financial imbalances are well known — a narrow and inequitable tax regime, limited export base, the energy sector’s circular debt, bankrupt public-sector enterprises, heavy regulatory burden and low savings and investment. Band-aid responses to these problems are no longer tenable. Comprehensive reforms have to be implemented to put Pakistan on the path to growth and investment. Establishing fast-track entities such as theSpecial Investment Facilitation Councilwhich ignore the unstable macroeconomic situation will yield modest results, if that.\n\nForeign policy issues for the next government will be no less pressing at a time when the world is in the midst of an intensely unstable period marked by growing geopolitical tensions, two major wars and persisting financial volatility. Making the task more challenging is the tense regional situation with Pakistan’s relations with three of its neighbours all in a troubled and fraught state. These changing global and regional dynamics urge the need for a wide-ranging review of foreign policy as well as a focus early in the government’s tenure on the country’s key bilateral relationships.\nThe question is how intellectually equipped are political parties that will form the next government to undertake all this. Have they done any thinking about the key issues consequential to the country’s future? Coming months will provide an answer to whether they have the policy wherewithal to govern effectively and not just wield power."}]}

In his second stint as prime minister, Shehbaz Sharifheadsa fragile six-party coalition, with his party lacking a majority and dependent for its survival on the PPP, which has opted to support the government while declining to join the cabinet.\nThis means the government will have to engage in sustained efforts to keep the PPP and other allies happy and meet their demands to retain their support. The minority government will face the vulnerabilities of coalition politics and have to deal with unpredictable coalition partners, with little assurance of stability. All this could distract it from the job of governance.\nThe Sharif government will face other constraints on its exercise of power. With PTI intent on resorting to agitational politics this will present the ruling coalition with a continuing challenge. As the opposition constitutes a large bloc in the National Assembly it will make the task of conducting parliamentary business more difficult. The disruptive conduct of PTI-backed MNAs in the Assembly’s initial sessions indicates the shape of things to come, especially as they promise to stage protests in every session. With little prospect of any pause in government-opposition tensions much less agreement on working parliament, their confrontation will pose obstacles to legislation and even paralyse proceedings.\nThe continuinghybridarrangement in which the military establishment has secured an expansive, informal role in governance will also limit the government’s power. In his previous term in office, Sharif ceded even more ground to the establishment. This is unlikely to be reversed or diminish in any significant way. It will mean the establishment will have continuing sway on how the country is run.\nThen there is the complex provincial landscape in which PML-N only controls one province, with the other three provinces run by different parties and a hostile government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This will also place limits on the Sharif government. Managing centre-province relations will pose an obvious challenge and require a deft combination of pragmatism and firmness. It will make the task of forging a national consensus on federal government policies more compelling and yet more problematic.\nWith constraints on its power the Sharif government has many challenges to navigate.\nBut none of these constraints should deter or prevent the government from charting a way to meet the many challenges the country faces. That, after all, is its responsibility. For this, the prime minister would need to evolve a clear and coherent policy agenda and select a competent team while avoiding the kind of unwieldy, bloated cabinet he appointed in his previous term.\nThe economic challenge is, of course, the most consequential and the choice of finance minister all-important. The Sharif government has to brace itself to take tough and politically painful decisions in order to secure the larger, extended programme it plans to seek from theIMFgiven Pakistan’s heavy foreign debt service obligations ahead.\nThe economic challenge is an imposing one, but the government should see an opportunity in this crisis. The choice for the government is stark. It can steer the country out of the present crisis by the same kind of fire-fighting responses witnessed in the past — more borrowing, bailouts and accumulating greater debt while postponing reform and creating no capacity to repay higher levels of debt. This, however, will only guarantee another crisis down the road and do nothing to spur growth and investment or contain the record level of inflation.\nThis band-aid approach is, in any case, now untenable. Alternatively, it can use the ongoing crisis as an opportunity to launch wide-ranging structural reforms and break out of the vicious cycle the economy is mired in — unsustainable financial imbalances, heavy domestic and foreign borrowing, soaring inflation, low savings and investment and stagnant growth.\nMany countries across the world faced an economic crisis more formidable than the one Pakistan is confronted with. But they were able to use that as an opportunity to bounce back stronger and more resilient. Southeast Asian nations that experienced a financial crisis in 1997 did that by undertaking fundamental reform and addressing structural problems through tough economic measures.\nSimilarly, India in the 1990s and several Latin American states in the 1980s and 1990s went through severe economic crises; they managed to not just recover but also embark on a path of robust growth and build economic sustainability. In each case, wrenching structural adjustments, tight fiscal policy and other reform measures were launched by leaders aided by able teams who were convinced that long-term commitment and consistent policy implementation were essential to move forward and that patchwork ‘solutions’ were in fact no solutions.\nWhile urgent priority needs to be given to establishing macroeconomic stability, another crisis consequential for Pakistan’s future also warrants the Sharif government’s attention. This is the crisis in human development — with most indicators of literacy, education, health, poverty and other aspects of social justice and human welfare deteriorating in recent years. The World Bank calls it a “silent, deep human capital crisis”, with Pakistan falling significantly in the global human development rankings.\nThe education emergency is reflected in the grim reality that Pakistan has the world’s second highest number of children — over 20 million — out of school. With 40 per cent of people illiterate, literacy levels are stagnant. Poverty has risen in recent years with an estimated 12.5m more people pushed into poverty in 2023 as compared to the previous year. The overall state of human development is so bleak that it suggests Pakistan may be sleepwalking to a disaster that can only be ignored at great peril to the country’s stability and economic progress.\nAdmittedly, these challenges have to be addressed in a fraught political environment in which constraints on the government’s power will weigh heavily on its ability to implement major policy actions. For that reason, the government should try to find ways to defuse political tensions and forge a political consensus on key measures. This won’t be easy. The government’s coalition partners will want to distance themselves from tough economic measures. Dissuading PTI leaders from their combative path will be equally difficult. But then, this is the test of leadership that awaits Shehbaz Sharif."}]}

Governments and people across the world have already started assessing this as the former president appears increasingly likely to return to power even though the election is far too early to call. But irrespective of who wins thepresidential race, there is a general perception of the US among the international community that is informing assessments about Washington’s future engagement with the world.\nThis concerns the intensely polarised state of the country, which frequently gridlocks the political system, threatens government shutdowns and paralyses Congress. So much so that agreement on the budget proves elusive, and even aid to America’s closest ally (Israel) fails to pass Congress. Institutional dysfunction and other challenges to its democracy compels administrations to be much more preoccupied with domestic challenges and troubles.\nThis in turn means Washington’s international engagement is neither seen as sustained nor consistent and US reliability also comes into question. This at a time when the US is no longer the sole dominant power in a growing multipolar world, which imposes limits on its power.\nThe prospect of another Trump presidency only reinforces this perception given both his unpredictability and ‘America First’ unilateralist approach, which produced so much disruption and discontinuity in foreign policy in his first term and eroded America’s international standing. His isolationist approach also made the country retrench from its global role.\nAs he is now a known quantity, will it be easier for the world to deal with him? Not necessarily. His mercurial and whimsical personality makes it uncertain whether his second term will just mimic the first and offer more of the same in foreign policy. His impulsiveness makes it difficult to gauge his future policies with certainty especially as he is capable of suddenly changing course.\nWhen Joe Biden became president, his defining phrase of how his administration would depart from Trump was ‘America is back’. It meant more expansive and energetic US engagement with the world in line with traditional US policy and global role. But in several core areas his approach was not different from that of his predecessor.\nIn others, his administration’s declaratory policy was not matched by operational reality, as for example the aim to ‘restore America’s global leadership’. OnChina, his policy differed little from Trump’s, except perhaps in tone. On trade their approach was identical. Trump-era tariffs not only remained intact but were supplemented by tech restrictions unleashing an intense tech war.\nBiden’s aggressive stance towards Beijing and policy to contain China of course reflected the political consensus in the US for a tougher posture towards Beijing. For their part, Chinese officials saw little to distinguish between Trump and Biden’s policies This prompted Chinese leaders to repeatedly warn Washington against engaging in a Cold War and describe the Biden administration’s strategy as one of ‘confrontational competition’.\nThe former president will be transactional in his dealings but also unpredictable.\nIn many respects, Biden’s worldview seemed stuck in the past and not in sync with a vastly transformed world. For example, his effort to cast the world into a defining battle between democracy and authoritarian rule was a throwback to a Cold War paradigm and rhetoric. The idea never took off, not least because American democracy itself had regressed.\nHis chaotic management of the US militarywithdrawalfrom Afghanistan was a major blow to US image and credibility. He failed to mediate peace to bring the costly Ukraine war to an end. His policy on Israel’s war inGazaisolated the US from the international community, which wanted the conflict to end, but instead, witnessed repeated American vetoes of ceasefire resolutions in the UN Security Council. This and Washington’s arming of Israel also eroded support for Biden from within his own party, especially among young and liberal Democrats.\nNot that Trump will be any different on this issue given his staunch pro-Israel stance, which also appeals to his supporters among evangelical Christians. He said last week that Israel should continue its military offensive until “complete victory” and “finish the problem”. His other utterances during the campaign have a familiar ring. He has repeated the America First rhetoric, talked of imposing new trade restrictions/ tariffs on China and ending its most favoured nation trading status.\nHe alsochastisedNato allies for not sharing the defence burden. He said in his second term, America would fundamentally rethink “Nato’s purpose and its mission” and ask European nations to reimburse the US billions of dollars for military supplies it sent to Ukraine. He even said he would encourage Russia to attack ‘delinquent’ Nato countries who don’t spend what they should on defence.\nMuch of this is campaign rhetoric. But there is little question that a man who brings business instincts to politics has a strong aversion to supporting wars or getting America embroiled in other people’s wars. Which is why European countries should worry most about his return and about the US security guarantee for Europe. Trump will likely force Ukraine into negotiations with Russia to seek a peace deal to end the war and would be unconcerned if the outcome favoured Moscow.\nHe has often bragged he can end the war in 24 hours. There is also strong opposition among Republicans and party supporters to aid for Ukraine. Trump’s stance on Ukraine has implications for the Taiwan issue, which he has seldom referred to. Trump has also never said America would intervene militarily if China ‘invaded’ Taiwan, as Biden once declared.\nBecause Trump has a transactional view of foreign relations that would make his policies unpredictable but also open to pragmatic possibilities. His administration would prefer to strike deals with competitors and rivals rather than try to subdue them, especially given his admiration for strongmen at the helm in some of these countries. His resistance to detail in his foreign policy pronouncements gives him room to manoeuvre and adapt.\nTrump’s more ambitious, if not sweeping, plans are on the domestic front, which aim to downsize the ‘administrative state’ and revamp the deep state but will also be driven by revenge. That means the American people will have more to fear from Trump’s return than the international community."}]}

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’scongratulatory messageto Shehbaz Sharif on his election as prime minister generated speculation in both countries about the future of ties between the two neighbours.\nThe message, however, was terse by past standards, as it contained no reference to any desire to improve relations. Sharif’s response was equally curt. In any case, reading anything more into a perfunctory exchange of messages would be a mistake given the complex and fraught nature of the relationship.\nThe diplomatic impasse between the two countries has persisted since August 2019, when relations plunged to a new low with India’s illegal annexation, bifurcation and absorption of the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir into the Indian union — in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. Formal dialogue and the peace process were suspended by India long before this. But Delhi’s 2019 action, accompanied by a prolonged lockdown in occupied Kashmir and sweeping restrictions, prompted Pakistan to suspend trade and downgrade diplomatic ties by recalling its high commissioner.\nIslamabad made the resumption of dialogue contingent upon India rescinding its August 2019 action. Delhi showed no interest in any talks, and instead, continued its repressive policy and human rights violations in Kashmir. It undertook a slew of legal, demographic, and electoral changes aimed at disempowering and dispossessing Kashmiri Muslims, dismissing Pakistan’s protests in this regard.\nA working relationship needs to be established without compromising Pakistan’s core interests.\nHowever, back-channel communication between the two countries during 2020-2021 raised hopes of a limited thaw. This led to the re-commitment by both neighbours in February 2021 to observe the ceasefire on the Line of Control, in accordance with a 2003 understanding. This was not unimportant, as only two years earlier, the nuclear neighbours were locked in a dangerous confrontation in the Pulwama-Balakot crisis, triggered by Indian air strikes inside Pakistani territory.\nThe LoC truce has mostly held for the past three years. But back-channel talks made no headway on any other front, including Kashmir, that could pave the way for a resumption of talks. The diplomatic deadlock continued even though sporadic communication on practical issues did take place, including on exchange of prisoners and visas for visits to religious sites.\nIn January 2023 Shehbaz Sharif, in his first stint as prime minister, called for “serious and sincere talks” with India to resolve “burning issues”, including Kashmir. In an interview with Al Arabiya, he said neighbours needed to live peacefully and voiced his willingness for talks. A subsequent official clarification reaffirmed Pakistan’s position that talks could only take place if India reversed its August 2019 action. Delhi responded by saying the atmosphere wasn’t conducive for talks.\nNevertheless, foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s May 2023 visit to India to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit offered an opportunity for at least some tentative re-engagement. But this proved a lost opportunity as no bilateral meeting took place on the sidelines. Instead, both sides engaged in mutual recriminations, with India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, accusing Bilawal of being the “spokesperson of a terrorism industry”.\nMeanwhile, another irritant was added last year to the troubled relationship already burdened by several unresolved disputes. This was over the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, which for six decades has survived wars, confrontations and tensions between the two countries. The stance Delhi adopted raised questions about the fate of the treaty that governs the sharing and management of trans-border rivers.\nIn early 2023, India notified Islamabad of its intention to modify the treaty’s dispute settlement provisions. It also boycotted a court of arbitration hearing at the Hague on Indian hydroelectric projects on Chenab and Jhelum rivers disputed by water-stressed Pakistan. The matter remains unresolved.\nIt is against this fraught backdrop that prospects for Pakistan-India relations have to be assessed. For a start, India is about to go to the polls with general elections expected in April-May. So, any diplomatic move would have to wait until after the outcome of the election. Whether Modi’s BJP resorts to its usual Pakistan-bashing during the election campaign may provide an indication of its intentions. Election rhetoric apart, India has already made it clear that Kashmir will no longer figure as a subject in any bilateral dialogue with Pakistan and that it is now off the negotiating table.\nDealing with India will pose an imposing challenge for the Sharif government in the face of this intransigent Indian position. There are two views about re-engagement with India. The first is that Pakistan should resume trade, restore diplomatic relations at high commissioner level and put Kashmir aside — a reversal of its well-known position.\nThis, however, would still be contingent on how serious India is on renewing formal dialogue with Pakistan. The second view is that such engagement will entirely be on India’s terms and tantamount to de facto endorsement of its August 2019 action and virtual abandonment of Kashmir.\nIndia has long wanted normalisation of ties without any settlement of outstanding disputes; accepting these terms would imply Pakistan has given up on its claims in these disputes. This would be next to impossible for any government to sell to the public. Therefore, Pakistan should play for time until it has strengthened its negotiating hand and also built economic strength for substantive re-engagement. After all, Pakistan has lived without a dialogue for well over five years.\nThe question that arises is whether there is any space between these two views or options that can enable Pakistan to establish some kind of working relationship with India — obviously on the basis of reciprocity, while not compromising on its principled, legal position on Kashmir? The need for a working relationship between the two nuclear neighbours cannot be disputed.\nRegular communication is essential to manage tensions and minimise the risk of miscalculation. There are also practical issues that need sustained dialogue. The restoration of high commissioner-level diplomatic relations, for example, can help in this regard and doesn’t compromise any of Pakistan’s core interests.\nEven if this space is limited, it is worth exploring to find a way of extricating the relationship from its frozen state but without breaching Pakistan’s clearly articulated red lines on core issues."}]}

Much of the Global South has welcomed this and seen it as an opportunity to forge closer relations with and benefit from an economically resurgent China. TheUShas, of course, cast China as a strategic threat — a classic response from an established superpower to the newest one, seen as a challenge to its dominant position. For the past several years, the bipartisan political consensus that has emerged in the US is to adopt a tougher stance towards Beijing and pursue a policy to contain China’s growing power. Successive administrations have adopted strategies to counter China on several fronts — from trade to technology as well as militarily and diplomatically.\nWestern paranoia about China is frequently reflected in the Western media. It is exemplified by coverage in the influential news weekly The Economist, which always depicts China as an aggressive, predatory power out to upend the prevailing international order. Most European countries, however, are reticent to take a hawkish approach, not least because China has now replaced the US as Europe’s biggest trading partner. China itself has long sought to project its ascent to global power status as a ‘peaceful rise’, portraying its extraordinary economic success, expanding international influence and increasing military strength as posing no threat to international peace and stability.\nThere is now a growing and rich body of literature on China’s rise, much of it written by Western authors and analysts. A new book by a Chinese scholar and economist is therefore a welcome addition. China’s World View: Demystifying China to Prevent Global Conflict by David Daokui Li offers a Chinese perspective on how the country works and what the implications are of its rise for the West. His aim is to challenge and allay Western concerns and anxieties about China, arguing that, instead of being a threat, the rise of China is good for the world for multiple reasons and a factor for international peace and prosperity. Li is uniquely positioned to relay this not only because he knows his own country but also for his understanding of the West, having spent several years studying there.\nStable Sino-US relations are the best guarantee for global peace and prosperity.\nHe is concerned that the gulf between the West and China is widening. On the part of Western power elites, Li sees a readiness to engage in a new Cold War, while on the Chinese side he sees a drive for a more aggressive response to the West, especially the US. These views are regarded by him as dangerous escalation of misunderstandings and miscalculations which could lead to a conflict that is entirely avoidable.\nAmong the reasons he identifies for widespread Western fears of the country is the timing of China’s rise, coinciding as it has with many Western countries not being “in the best political and economic shape” and facing many troubles. This has eroded Western confidence and produced an “overreaction” to China’s ascent. It has caused US politicians to blame China for America’s socioeconomic problems.\nAnother reason he cites is that while China has built a market economy, it has advanced without having the institutions of Western democracy, which is seen by some in the West as a threat to their values if China becomes more powerful. This is despite the fact that Beijing has no interest in exporting the so-called Chinese model. China’s technological progress including in AI is also a source of Western worry, he writes, adding that China has the world’s largest pool of engineers and is poised to become a world leader in AI along with the US.\nTo promote a deeper understanding of China, Li’s book ranges over its society, governance institutions, including the all-pervasive role of the Chinese Communist Party, how its economy works, population policy and its education system. The author also deconstructs the various elements of China’s world view, and discusses what informs them. One of the chapters on the economy provides sharp insights into how private businesses operate. He points out that they are powering the country’s economic growth and account for over 75 per cent of national economic output while state-owned enterprises have undergone reform. Several generations of private entrepreneurs have emerged since the reforms of the 1980s but they all encountered social prejudice, had to deal with challenges of working with the government and navigate the tricky shoals of politics. His discussion of the government’s concern over big internet platforms and their owners’ influence bears close similarity to US concerns about their own social media giants.\nThe chapter on China’s world view is especially instructive. He defines world view as general principles agreed among the country’s policymakers and educated public. Among its seven strands Li regards three as more important. One, China should work on domestic issues before tackling foreign affairs — “homework first.” Two, earning respect is all-important in international affairs. And three, engage cooperatively with the US but be guided by clear principles and take a firm stand on core interests including Taiwan and technological development. Another element in the world view is that China should not seek to export its ‘model’ abroad.\nIn the book’s final chapter, Li marshals out his core argument that China’s rise is good for the world especially for ordinary people. This is because it has offered new economic opportunities for many people in the world — bringing more global public goods, speedier progress in science and technology, space exploration and peacekeeping in war zones. Low prices of Chinese-exported goods have benefited low-income families across the world. Competition with China has also goaded countries especially the US to spend more on education, science and technology. Moreover, China has no interest in disrupting the international order or seeking any conflict. Li believes US-China war is avoidable and improbable.\nWhether or not one agrees with the optimistic note on which the book ends, there can be little disagreement with the view that a cooperative and stable relationship between China and the US is the best guarantee for global peace, security and prosperity. This crisply written book on one of the defining issues of our era serves as a persuasive reality check on exaggerated or unfounded fears of China’s rise."}]}

They plunged to a new low earlier this month when Pakistan carried outair strikeson hideouts of the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan inside Afghanistan. This was in retaliation to a series of cross-border terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil, including adeadlyone in North Waziristan that claimed the lives of several security personnel.\nThe attack prompted ISPR to directly hold Kabul responsible, saying, “The Afghan interim government is not only arming terrorists but also providing a safe haven for terrorist organisations involved in incidents of terrorism in Pakistan”. In fact, since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, Islamabad repeatedly cautioned Kabul that its failure to act against TTP would force Pakistan’s hand. But these warnings were in vain.\nAlthough Pakistan has undertaken kinetic actions before against militant bases in Afghanistan, they were rare and always undeclared. In a significant departure from the past, this time Islamabad went public to send a strong message to Kabul. The foreign ministry declared that “intelligence-based terrorist operations” had been conducted in Afghanistan’s border regions. The statement recalled that Afghan authorities had been repeatedly urged “to take effective action to ensure that Afghan soil is not used as a staging ground for terrorism against Pakistan”.\nKabul reacted by issuing toughly worded statements that condemned the attacks as violations of Afghan territory. Its defence ministry announced that “In response to that aggression, the border forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan targeted military bases of Pakistan’s army across the artificial Durand Line with heavy weapons”. The reference to the border as “artificial” was particularly provocative.\nSignificant improvement in relations depends on Kabul’s response to Pakistan’s security concerns.\nWhile the air strikes served as evidence of Pakistan’s coercive diplomacy towards the Taliban, Islamabad’s increasingly tough approach has also involved use of its considerable leverage. All this aims to raise the costs for Kabul for its lack of movement on the TTP issue. It seeks to compel Taliban leaders to change course on an issue deemed critical to Pakistan’s security. Pakistan’s ‘asks’ of the Taliban over the past two years have been to disarm the TTP, detain its leaders and rein in its violent activities. Despite assurances Taliban leaders have done little to meet these demands, asking instead for time and invoking other excuses on this count.\nThe two other instruments Pakistan has deployed to mount pressure on Kabul concern transit trade restrictions and expulsion of illegal Afghan refugees. Both actions were taken in the backdrop of a spike in militant attacks in Pakistan. Last year saw almost 800 terror incidents most of which Pakistani officials attributed to TTP and other militants including Islamic State-Khorasan Province residing in Afghanistan. This represented an increase of over 50 per cent in violent incidents over previous years.\nIn October 2023, Islamabad sought to tighten the transit trade regime by imposing a ban on a number of items that could be imported by Afghanistan via Pakistan; these were officially designated as products “prone to smuggling”. It also slapped a processing fee on several categories of commercial goods transiting through Pakistan to Afghanistan. Afghan importers were also required to submit bank guarantees to ensure imported goods reached the stated destination.\nFor sure, the principal driver of these measures was to curb smuggling. But they also had another objective — to ratchet up pressure on Kabul to respond to Pakistan’s security concerns. The Taliban certainly understood the message and accused Pakistan of politicising trade. But in several rounds of talks, worried Afghan officials urged Pakistan to decouple trade from terrorism.\nAt around the same time, in October 2023, Pakistani authorities ordered the expulsion of undocumented Afghans residing in the country, estimated to be around 700,000. The action was linked to the official assessment announced publicly that the majority of suicide bombings last year were carried out by Afghan nationals. This evoked criticism from Kabul, especially over the tight time frame in which the repatriation process was executed.\nIt also provoked criticism from international human rights organisations and the UN. But none of this deterred the government from pressing on in November with repatriating Afghans living illegally in the country. So far, well over half a million have been sent back. A second phase is now on the anvil with the decision to deport around 600,000 Afghan citizen card holders; these cards were issued by Pakistan a few years ago. This plan is expected to become operational next month.\nThe Pakistan government is also rigorously enforcing the ‘one document’ regime at every border crossing with Afghanistan. Implemented gradually over the years, this measure requires Afghans entering Pakistan to possess a valid passport and visa. Previously, other forms of identification and travel permits were accepted. From November 2023, the passport/visa regime was extended to every border crossing including most recently Chaman. This met with resistance from Taliban authorities and criticism, including public protests by tribesmen and traders living on Pakistan’s side of the border. But it hasn’t dissuaded Islamabad from robustly executing a measure seen as essential for border security.\nAlthough Pakistan-Afghanistan relations entered another phase of tensions in the wake of Pakistani air strikes this didn’t lead to any suspension of communication or diplomatic disengagement. The mutual desire to avoid a breakdown in relations and continue bilateral engagement is reflected in the visit to Kabul last week — after the air strikes — of an official delegation led by Pakistan’s commerce secretary to discusstradeissues.\nOfficials say the delegation went with an open mind to show flexibility on Afghan concerns on trade. They later claimed progress was achieved. The Afghan side announced several agreements were reached in the talks including removal of the bank guarantee for imports. This indicated Islamabad was now using carrots, not just sticks in its policy approach.\nHowever, any significant improvement in the fraught relationship will be contingent on how and when the Taliban respond to Pakistan’s demands on TTP.\nThe hope of Pakistani officials is that the combined effect of Pakistan’s coercive diplomacy and other measures including selective inducements will persuade the Taliban to finally move on this count. The coming months will determine how effective this approach turns out to be and whether such hopes will materialise."}]}

With over 33,000 Palestinians killed and more than 75,000 injured by Israel’s relentless military assaults, almost two-thirds of Gaza’s infrastructure lies in ruins and 1.9 million people have been displaced. Little humanitarian assistance is reaching desperate Palestinians who face famine and catastrophic conditions amid continued bombardment by Israel. No place is safe in Gaza while raids and killings also continue in the occupied West Bank.\nIsrael’s latest atrocity last week was anair strikeon foreign aid workers of an international charity delivering food in central Gaza. Despite their clearly marked vehicles the convoy was attacked and six humanitarian workers killed. This prompted widespread international condemnation, compelling Israel to claim it was “an unintended strike” and order an investigation. President Joe Biden also expressed outrage over the killings saying Israel had not done enough to protect civilian lives. This wasn’t the first time Israel targeted aid workers. They have been attacked throughout the war and innocent Palestinians flocking to aid distribution venues also killed.\nAt the same time, chilling details have emerged about the condition of Gaza’s largest hospital Al Shifa after the Israeli army pulled out following a two-week operation. It left behind a trail ofdeath and destructionwith hundreds of dead bodies found in the hospital complex and surrounding areas, where many Palestinians had sought refuge. Eye witnesses said the hospital was left in shambles with anAl Jazeeracorrespondent reporting “There is no life here. The complex is in ruins and cannot be revived.” All this being the result of Israel’s deliberate destruction of Gaza’s health sector.\nBy continuing its military operations, Israel has defied the will of the international community reflected in the call for a ceasefire by theresolution adoptedby the UN Security Council (UNSC) on March 25. It was the first time in the six-month war that the Council finally demanded an immediate ceasefire albeit for the remaining period of Ramazan. This was near unanimous with 14 of 15 Council members voting in favour. The US abstained but did not veto unlike the three previous ceasefire resolutions it had vetoed. The US stance signified a tentative policy shift. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the US failure to cast a veto as a “clear retreat” from its previous position. However, US opposition to a ‘permanent ceasefire’ meant the ceasefire call was confined to just the month of Ramazan. Meanwhile, a remark by America’s UN ambassador that this resolution wasn’t binding evoked widespread criticism.\nUS frustration has been growing but Israel has continued its genocidal war on Gaza.\nUN Security Council resolutions in fact constitute international law. All are binding and have to be implemented as enjoined by Article 25 of the UN Charter. This binds members to “accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council”. True, resolutions under Chapter VII of the Charter (threats and breaches of peace) have an enforcement mechanism, including sanctions in the case of non-compliance. Those under Chapter VI (pacific settlement of disputes) don’t. Though the Gaza resolution was under the latter that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have to be enforced. UN Secretary General António Guterres made it plain that the “resolution must be implemented” and that “failure would be unforgivable”.\nIsrael has refused to comply with this resolution in line with its long- standing record of defying innumerable other UNSC resolutions on Palestine over the decades. It has shown utter disregard for global opinion that has for months demanded the war be brought to an end. Arguably, the US is the only country Israel would listen to and which has leverage with Tel Aviv. But in election year, the Biden administration made little effort in the past six months to mount pressure on Israel to change course.\nThere are signs now that this is changing. Opinion in the US has shifted significantly against Israel. The latest Gallup poll released last month found the majority of Americans disapprove of Israel’s military actions in Gaza. Disapproval among Democratic voters is even higher, at 75 per cent.\nDomestic and global opinion as well as the dire situation on the ground seems to have weighed in with Washington for Biden to call, for the first time, for an immediate pause in the war. He is reported to have said this in a tense phone conversation with the Israeli prime minister last Thursday. He also warned him that US support would depend on how Tel Aviv addresses humanitarian suffering in Gaza, which he called “unacceptable”. Washington is now under mounting international pressure to halt lethal arms supplies to Israel. Recently the UN Human Rights Council also demanded a halt in military sales.\nIn Israel itself public protests against Netanyahu have been intensifying with calls for his resignation and early elections. Demonstrators have been demanding the government secure the release of hostages in Hamas custody. They have also demanded the war should be ended to bring hostages home. Losing support at home, Netanyahu’s government ordered an air strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, which killed several members of the Revolutionary Guard Corps including a commander.\nThis marked an obvious effort to drag Iran into a regional war. While Tehran has vowed to retaliate it has little to gain from a direct conflict, which would also shift attention away from Gaza. Iranian leaders know this is an Israeli trap to provoke Teheran into taking military action to draw in the US and pitch it against Iran. But this incident shows how Israel is escalating on every front as it has also launched missile strikes in eastern Lebanon.\nWith UN action having failed to halt Israel’s war on Gaza and Washington unable or unwilling to restrain Israel, the question is what have Muslim countries done to mount pressure on Israel to stop it from continuing ethnic cleansing and committing war crimes? Arab and OIC countries have been active at the UN to push for a ceasefire resolution. Egypt and Qatar, along with the US, are mediating talks in Cairo between Hamas and Israel for a durable ceasefire and release of hostages though this has yet to yield an outcome.\nStill Muslim countries have fallen way short of the expectations of Muslims across the world. Nor has their response matched the catastrophic situation on the ground."}]}

Economic development, in fact, depends on good governance. And this, in turn, has much to do with the quality of governance institutions, their responsiveness to public needs and people’s faith in them.\nIn an increasingly complex world, governance challenges have become more daunting. New technologies have created unprecedented flows of instant information to heighten the challenge. Technology has empowered citizens and increased their expectations of what governments should deliver. But governments are seen to lack agility in a fast-moving world.\nThe international debate on governance in the 21st century has produced a rich body of literature. During the Covid-19 pandemic, this conversation intensified as assessments were made of which countries managed the health crisis better and whether democracies did a more efficient job than authoritarian systems. Fareed Zakaria, in his bookTen Lessons for the Post-Pandemic World, argued that while democracies had a better record, it was a “competent, well-functioning, trusted state” and quality of governance that were instrumental in tackling the pandemic effectively.\nSimilarly, the American political scientist Francis Fukuyama asserted it was not the type of political system that determined capable management but an effective state. In a2020 essay, he argued the crucial determinant in efficient crisis response is state capacity and trust in government. “What matters in the end is not regime type but whether citizens trust their leaders, and whether those leaders preside over a competent and effective state.”\nPakistan has much to learn from the global debate to reimagine governance.\nThe unsettled post-Covid period saw unprecedented, overlapping challenges confront countries across the world. This prompted the World Bank to call for reimagining governance. ItsFuture of Government report (2022) focused attention on the need for governments to tackle unresolved governance problems.\n\nIt saw the world at an inflection point due to growing demands, economic headwinds and mistrust, as well as persistence of chronic failures such as the learning crisis and job insecurity. The report called for a new social contract supported by an elite bargain by which elites committed to outcomes to benefit society at large and not just themselves. It proposed a “government of the future” with a clear vision of its role — innovative, trusted, prepared for crisis and responsive to the demands of citizens.\nOver the years, the World Bank also advanced the governance debate by its efforts to evaluate and measure the quality of governance of countries. Its worldwide governance indicators represent a compilation of data that captures perceptions of the quality of governance in over 200 countries and territories. They measure six dimensions of governance — voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence/ terrorism, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and control of corruption.\nIn the global rankings based on assessment of these dimensions, Singapore, Finland, Norway and Denmark were among top performers in the 2022 rankings, with Pakistan among the bottom group of countries.\nA different contribution to the governance debate was made by an insightful book published some years back titledIntelligent Governance for the 21st Century: A Middle Way between West and Eastby Nicolas Berggruen and Nathan Gardels. The authors examined whether there was a need to reimagine government as political systems were not delivering effective governance. They offered a compelling idea that both East and West should learn and adapt from one another to combine “knowledgeable democracy” with “accountable meritocracy”.\nFor the authors, the question was not if Western-style democracy would triumph over rule by a meritocratic Mandarinate rooted in China’s ancient “institutional civilisation”, or the other way around. Instead, they asked whether a “middle way” between them could be evolved.\nBy this, they meant finding a balance between meritocracy and democracy, and between authority and freedom to create the most “intelligent form of governance”. They suggested drawing on the ‘best practices’ from both to evolve hybrid institutional arrangements that fused elements of popular democracy with the Confucian tradition of a learned meritocracy.\nBut they stressed the need for reform in Western and Eastern political systems alike, as both faced challenges. They argued that polarisation, dysfunction, decay and ideological rigidity afflict governance systems in much of the West. Without reform, electoral democracy anchored in a consumer culture of instant gratification is headed towards “terminal decline”. This is because it prioritises short-term interests, unmitigated by robust deliberative institutions, which have become weaker and unable to pursue the public good. In the US, democracy appears unable to self-correct.\n\nOn the other hand, China adopts a long-term governance perspective, can take tough decisions, and robustly implement them. China’s operative system is predicated on the meritocratic tradition of learned and experienced elites and reflected in the modern Mandarinate of the Communist Party. This enables it to chart a long-term path, which explains its extraordinary rise. But the Chinese system is also under stress and needs correction because it “lacks accountability” and faces mounting demands from its people for democratic checks on arbitrary authority and cronyism.\nThis discussion leads the authors to contend that the best attributes of both Eastern and Western systems can help to produce a template of “intelligent governance”. This means striking a balance between rights and responsibilities, as well as ensuring a check on populist and partisan impulses by injecting the perspective of the long-term and common good in a strong deliberative institution.\n\nChina would “need more participatory involvement” and greater accountability; “The US would need a more depoliticised democracy in which governance for the long term and common good is insulated from the populist short-term special interest political culture”.\nWhile every country has to choose its own governance system and development path, there is much to learn from the governance debate.\nSeveral core principles of good governance have universal application — framing and implementing policy in the public interest by an inclusive process that meets the requirements of legitimacy, competence and accountability and gives primacy to merit over cronyism. Pakistan has yet to apply these principles to the way it is governed."}]}

The escalatory cycle of retaliation pu­­s­h­­­ed the region to the precipice of a regional conflag­­­ration. But both countries seemed to pull back from the brink amid global calls for de-escalation.\nThe latest escalation of violence was sparked by Israel’s April 1air strikeon Iran’s consulate in Damascus which killed seven members of the Revolutionary Guards including a top commander. This raised the stakes in a volatile situation with Iranretaliatingwith an unprecedented missile and drone attack targeting military installations in Israel. There were no casualties in what was a measured response. Iranian officials said it was not designed to inflict damage but send a message that Israel would have to pay for any action that breached Iran’s red lines. In response, Israel launched anundeclared drone strikeat a military target in Isfahan, which also caused no damage. Iranian officials played down the “failed attack”, claiming three drones had been intercepted and indicating they had no intention to retaliate.\nThis marked the first direct military confrontation between the two adversaries who have long engaged in covert conflict. Israel has carried out assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists, sabotage and strikes on Iranian assets in third countries while Iran-backed armed groups have been firing rockets across Israel’s border, although there is little equivalence between the two. With this conflict out of the shadows, the rules of the game have changed in the Middle East.\nBoth countries have crossed each other’s red lines. Iran’s retaliatory action sought to establish a new level of deterrence aimed at preventing more Israeli attacks inside Iran and on Iranian assets elsewhere. Tehran had previously never directly responded to such attacks by striking Israel from Iranian soil. This changed equation prompted the leader of Israel’s opposition to claim that his country’s deterrence policy had been damaged. Israel’s counterstrike on Iran, however small, sought to limit that damage and restore deterrence.\nDanger of regional conflict will not recede until the war in Gaza is ended.\nCondemnation of Iran’s assault on Israel was fast and furious from the US and other Western countries, who did not bother to similarly denounce the first Israeli strike, which was in violation of international law and the Vienna Convention. But such censure was overshadowed by mounting international concerns that further retaliatory actions would trigger a full-blown regional war. Iran threatened to respond with “greater force” if Israel launched another attack.\nAll this created an explosive situation. With no country wanting a slide into dangerous escalation a flurry of public calls followed, including from Israel’s closest allies, urging restraint on Tel Aviv. The most significant message came from President Joe Biden who called for restraint but also served notice to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that if he went ahead with military action the US would not be part of it. Anxious Arab countries signalled they would not allow US military bases on their soil to be used in any attack on Iran. American officials repeatedly declared, “We don’t want to see a wider regional war.” Public opinion in America is strongly averse to involvement in a faraway, foreign war. This is also evident from the lack of public interest and waning political support for the Ukraine conflict. With a looming election, this poses obvious political risks for Biden.\nMeanwhile, the UN Security Council met in emergency session on April 14 to discuss the situation. The usual divisions were evident, which meant no Council statement was issued. The envoys of Israel and Iran traded threats and heated accusations, with the US representative lashing out at Iran. But Council members were unanimous in calling for restraint. UN Secretary General António Guterres told the meeting the region was on the brink and de-escalation was necessary as there was “a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict”.\nThe increasingly unpopular Netanyahu government came under domestic pressure to act, ostensibly to shore up deterrence as well as its own position, with much pressure coming from its far-right members. To discourage Netanyahu from escalatory action and prevent an expansion of the war, the US announced new sanctions against Iran’s drone manufacturers to “degrade its military capacity”. Britain followed suit while the EU is also poised to impose sanctions on Iran.\nBut these measures and entreaties did not dissuade the Israeli leadership from launching a military strike against Iran, although it neither confirmed nor denied it did this. US urgings may have persuaded Tel Aviv to moderate its retaliatory action. Israel maintained deniability so as not to provoke another Iranian response. Iranian officials for their part were quoted as saying they saw no need to respond to a “non-attack”. With the score even, there is some hope that the situation will calm down now and tensions will gradually de-escalate.\nBut the risk of miscalculation remains high in a fraught and volatile environment. Either side can still misread the other’s intentions and the situation can spiral out of control. Speaking in the Security Council, Guterres pointed to this: “One miscalculation, one miscommunication, one mistake, could lead to the unthinkable — a full-scale regional conflict that would be devastating for all involved — and for the rest of the world.”\nThat danger will not recede so long as the war in Gaza continues. Israel has taken this brutal war into the seventh month, with over 34,000 Palestinians killed and more than 76,000 injured by its relentless military onslaught, which has inflicted untold suffering on the people. It refused to comply with a UNSC resolution calling for a ceasefire during Ramazan, flouting international law. It defied all norms of humanity by blocking humanitarian assistance for desperate people facing famine. Meanwhile, talks in Cairo between Israel and Hamas for a durable ceasefire and release of hostages have ground to a halt. Qatar, which is mediating the talks along with Egypt and the US, is now signalling it may give up its mediatory role.\nIf the major powers don’t want the ongoing crisis to snowball into a regional conflict, they have to prevail on Israel to end its war in Gaza."}]}

This is how an important new book sees what advanced artificial intelligence and biotechnology can mean for the future of humanity.The Coming Wavejoins a growing body of literature on one of the defining dynamics of the 21st century — the transformative impact of new technology. Its author Mustafa Suleyman, is uniquely qualified to assess both the opportunities for human advancement offered by new technologies and challenges, which can result in dystopian outcomes. He is the co-founder of two AI companies, which did innovative work in this field. Therefore, his perspectives are those of a tech insider.\nHis book takes forward the global discourse on the promise and perils of new technology. An illuminating work co-authored by Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel Huttenlocher,The Age of AI: and our Human Future, published in 2021, also made a significant contribution to this debate. In fact, AI breakthroughs are now outpacing understanding of their full implications at a time when predictions abound that AI capabilities will exceed those of humans within a few years.\nModern technology has powered multiple positive developments — empowering people, improving lives, increasing productivity, advancing medical and scientific knowledge and transforming societies. Technological developments have helped to fuel unprecedented social and economic progress. But advanced technologies are also creating disruption, new vulnerabilities and harmful repercussions, which have yet to be mitigated or effectively managed.\nSuleyman shows how the coming wave of technology will take human history to a turning point. The two core technologies that constitute the coming wave — AI and biotechnology — will bring about unprecedented progress and wealth. But their proliferation will also unleash many adverse effects, even “catastrophe on an unimaginable scale”. He calls this the “great meta-problem of the 21st century”, which his thought-provoking book examines by focusing on the bind that exists between risks and rewards and how to deal with it. Suleyman’s principal concern is how to “constrain” technology so that it serves and does not hurt humanity. He discusses what he calls the “containment problem”, the task of ensuring control of valuable technology as it gets cheaper, more accessible and spreads faster than ever before.\nCan the harmful aspects of new technology be contained?\nFor Suleyman, human history can be told through a series of waves. Explaining what he means by a wave he says it is “a set of technologies coming together around the same time powered by one or several new general-purpose technologies with profound societal implications”. He incisively recounts the history of technology and how it spreads with both intended and unintended consequences, giving rise to the containment challenge.\nHe describes technology’s inevitable challenge to be its makers losing control over the trajectory their inventions take once they are readily available. The uses to which these inventions are put are not in anyone’s control. They are unpredictable and also difficult to forestall. This, in turn, produces what Suleyman terms “revenge effects”, which means technology going in the wrong direction at odds with its original purpose. Technology always creates problems that makes containment necessary to check its harmful effects on society. Yet the containment problem remains unresolved. But according to Suleyman, there is an exception — nuclear technology, the most “contained technology in history”. Its spread has been curbed by the non-proliferation policy of nuclear powers driven by fears about their devastating effects. Also, nuclear weapons are immensely complex and costly to develop.\nThe book’s survey of AI’s evolution, punctuated by his own company’s discoveries, makes compelling reading. The author casts the advent of AI and synthetic biology to be an inflection point as these technologies address the world’s two foundational principles, intelligence and life. They are opening up unprecedentedly new areas, engineering life and competing with and even threatening to overtake human intelligence. This technological wave, with AI as its pivot, will be tougher to contain. But understanding it, writes Suleyman, will be the key to accurately assess its many ramifications, especially as mass-scale AI is now advancing by leaps and bounds. The book details progress in biotechnology and genetic engineering, which is also taking place at extraordinary speed and ushering in the “age of synthetic life”. But other transformative technologies, such as robotics and quantum computing, are also part of the new wave.\nSuleyman seeks to convincingly demonstrate why the coming wave has no historical precedent and is so consequential. This urges the need to strike a balance between its promise and hard-headed caution. He identifies four features integral to the coming wave — the technologies are multi-use, they “hyper-evolve”, have “asymmetric impacts” and are increasingly autonomous.\nIn an insightful discussion of the ‘Grand Bargain’ between citizens and the state, he sets out the threats posed by new technologies to this delicate equilibrium. This, he posits, is “fracturing the grand bargain”. It is putting the political order under great strain and undermining already fragile and increasingly divided nation-states especially in the West, where trust has been declining. This makes it harder for them to manage modern technology, which in turn weakens their power and governing capacity. Meanwhile, tech-empowered “bad actors” erode the state’s ability to provide security to its citizens. Deepfakes and weaponisation of information pose another threat.\nGiven these and many other dangers, as well as the disastrous consequences the next wave of technology can entail, Suleyman gets to the book’s core argument: how to make containment possible without foregoing its enormous benefits. Regula­tion is not enough. He sees containment as a set of interlocking technical, cultural, legal, political and governance mechanisms to ensure societal control of technology. And he proposes both the public and private sector should partner in this endeavour.\nTen steps are outlined towards containment. They include building technical safety, audits for accountability, reconciling profit with social purpose, assigning a proactive role to government in monitoring technology and, at the in­­ternational level, collaboration to harmonise laws and programmes. Containment, the book con­­cludes, is not “a resting place” but “a narrow and never-ending path”. Whether such an ambitious menu of measures can be put into practice is an open question. But there can be no disagreem­ent with Suleyman’s bold call for urgent action to constrain the harmful aspects of new technology."}]}

But it has not yielded any agreement on the key issues that divide them and drive tensions in their intense strategic competition — Taiwan, war in Ukraine, trade, technology curbs and military postures, especially in the South China Sea.\nThevisitof the US secretary of state to Beijing in late April was part of the effort to improve communication and contain tensions between the two countries. Antony Blinken’s trip took place against a mixed background of escalating tensions but also modest advances in cooperation and communication in certain areas.\nThis resulted from themeetinglast November between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinpingon the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in San Francisco. Their first face-to-face meeting in over a year produced a tentative thaw in frosty ties. It led to restoration of high-level military-to-military contacts, suspended by Beijing in 2020, and agreement on counter-narcotics cooperation.\nLast month, the two leaders also spoke on the phone. Increased dialogue was reflected in the conversation between the defence ministers and US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen’s visit to China last month. The first talks on artificial intelligence between the two countries are due to take place in coming weeks.\nBut just hours before Blinken’s arrival in Beijing, the US Congress approved billions of dollars of assistance for Taiwan and to counter China in the so-called Indo-Pacific region. This was part of a$61bn aid packagethat included funding for Ukraine and Israel. It also involved the requirement for TikTok’s Chinese parent company to sell its stake in the social media platform or face a ban in America. In election year, US officials have threatened higher tariffs on Chinese imports, with Biden calling for tripling tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium — clearly as part of his re-election campaign.\nNot surprisingly, Blinken was told at the outset of his trip that the US had to choose between cooperation and confrontation. China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during the talks that while dialogue and cooperation had increased in “various fields”, “negative factors” in the relationship are “still rising and accumulating”. He warned against any transgression of China’s red lines. A Chinese foreign ministry statement said Wang also criticised Washington for taking “an endless stream of measures to suppress China’s economy, trade, science and technology”, aimed at containment of China.\nBut he acknowledged “the China-US relationship is beginning to stabilise” and called for progress in areas where the two countries agreed. This was echoed by Blinken, who said the US “seeks to deepen cooperation where our interests align”, while reaffirming US commitmentto “maintaining and strengthening lines of communication to advance that agenda and deal responsibly with differences to avoid any miscalculations”.\nBoth the US and China want to avoid a collision course even as their strategic competition intensifies.\nThe high point of Blinken’s visit was of course the meeting with President Xi. That the Chinese president received him indicated Beijing’s desire to calm tensions with Washington. Warning against “vicious competition”, President Xi told Blinken that the US and China should be partners and not rivals — who “help each other succeed and not harm each other”. China, he said, wants to see a “confident, open and prosperous United States” but expected the US to see China’s development in a positive light. According to a statement issued by the Chinese foreign ministry, Xi also told Blinken that both sides “should honour words with actions rather than say one thing and do another”. He called for “mutual coexistence” and emphasised the need to follow through on what was agreed between him and President Biden in San Francisco to improve bilateral relations.\nThe readout from the American side was that Blinken conveyed US concerns on a number of issues, especially China’s military assistance to Russia in the Ukraine war. Speaking to the media before the meeting, he said Russia “would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China’s support”, pointing out that Beijing supplied machine tools and several dual-use items critical for Russia’s defence industry. This posed a threat not just to Ukraine but also to Europe and was a red line for Washington. He said after the meeting the US will wait to see how China addresses this concern, warning that sanctions could be imposed if Beijing did not respond. This injected a jarring note into the otherwise positive atmospherics of Blinken’s trip. The Chinese reaction was predictably sharp. A foreign ministry spokesman rejected “groundless” US accusations as an effort to shift blame, while Wang made it clear that “China is neither the creator of the Ukraine crisis nor a party to it”. But days later, Washington went ahead and sanctioned several Chinese companies for supplying Russia with components for military use.\nNevertheless, Blinken’s visit reflected an effort by both sides to stabilise the relationship and limit the turbulence and volatility that have come to characterise Sino-US ties. But beyond this effort to ease tensions, which is important, there was no evidence of any narrowing of differences between the two sides on core issues. Moreover, the run-up to the US presidential election in November is likely to see a significant amount of China-bashing, given the political consensus and popular sentiment in America that advocates a tougher posture towards Beijing. Both Biden and Donald Trump can be expected to vie with each other in striking a more aggressive stance on China.\nTaiwan will continue to be a dangerous flashpoint in the US-China confrontation, especially as the region surrounding it is bristling with heightened military activity. The military build-up and a series of recent incidents in the South China Sea also present obvious risks. The resumption of high-level military contacts between China and the US will be important to enable the two countries to reduce the risk of any inadvertent or accidental conflict.\nEven if the recent US-China diplomatic engagement has not produced any breakthroughs on contentious issues, it indicates that neither side wants unmanaged tensions to push the two countries onto a collision course, which would have unpredictable consequences for them as well as the rest of the world."}]}

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is widely predicted to win a third term in office. The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) goal is for its National Democratic Alliance to secure 400-plus seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha — a target encapsulated in the party slogan abki baar 400 paar. There are doubts this can be achieved, especially as voter turnout has been lower in the first three phases of the election compared to 2019. Election outcomes are never foregone conclusions.\nIn the 2019 election, the BJP won 303 seats. With its allies, its support in the Lower House swelled to 352 seats. This time, it hopes to win 370 seats on its own as it does not see the opposition as much of a challenge. Although the party secured comfortable parliamentary majorities in the previous two elections to enable it to rule unhindered in its decade in power, well over half the electorate did not vote for BJP. In 2019, BJP polled around 38 per cent of the popular national vote; in 2014 it was less than 31pc. This indicates its real support, even though the first-past-the-post electoral system gave it an outsized share of Lok Sabha seats.\nThe BJP has benefited from a weak, divided and regionally fragmented opposition. The Congress party looks jaded and bereft of new ideas. Leading an opposition alliance called ‘INDIA’ (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance), Congress has been unable to capture the public imagination or offer a credible alternative to the BJP’s narrative. It has struggled to counter Modi’s extravagant claims about his government’s achievements. Positive developments on India’s economic front have not all resulted from the Modi government’s policies but are entirely attributed to him by the BJP’s vigorous social media and propaganda campaign.\nModi’s carefully cultivated strongman image has yielded significant political dividends. This rests on claims of providing firm and incorruptible leadership, achieving economic development, benefiting India’s poor, and ‘connecting’ to ordinary people. More importantly, theHindutva agendais woven into his cult of personality, with the party portraying Modi as the champion and saviour of Hindu nationalism. His anti-Muslim actions and rhetoric have served to burnish those credentials.\nThe outlook for India-Pakistan relations is troubled if Modi returns to power.\nModi has sought to mobilise electoral support on his economic record, welfare and infrastructure projects, as well as his Hindu supremacist ideology. Even though rising unemployment and the soaring cost of living will weigh on voters’ minds, Modi is seen by many Indians to be a better bet on the economy than his opponents. He enjoys the backing of big business, for which the opposition accuses Modi of pandering to India’s super rich. In campaign speeches, Modi has repeatedly stated he has enhanced India’s international standing and helped to attract more foreign investment. He has even cast the election to be about making India “a major world power”.\nThe opposition’s attack on Modi has principally focused on his authoritarian conduct and policies. Certainly, democratic backsliding during his 10 years in power has been substantial and far reaching. This, his critics say, has turned India into an illiberal democracy. Judicial independence and media freedom have been undermined and civil liberties eroded. Modi’s government has muffled dissent, intimidated the media, harassed and incarcerated journalists and mounted extraordinary pressure on the opposition. Two state leaders allied with Congress,Arvind Kejriwaland Hemant Soren, have been jailed on dubious corruption charges. In March, the Congress party’s main bank accounts were frozen. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was expelled from parliament last year on the charge ofdefamationfor ridiculing Modi’s name. Later, his jail sentence was suspended by the supreme court.\nModi has pledged to push ahead with his Hindutva agenda, for which the party points to several actions taken by the government, including construction of theRam temple, a citizenship law disadvantaging Muslims, and revocation of Article 370 of the constitution, which gave Jammu and Kashmir special status. Modi has used toxic anti-Muslim rhetoric throughout his election campaign. He has called Muslims “infiltrators” and said they “have too many children” in an effort to scare Hindu voters into believing Muslims will eventually outnumber them. He hasrepeatedly accusedthe Congress party of favouring Muslims and conspiring to transfer wealth “looted” from Hindus to Muslims. The BJP has also posted videos containing these allegations. This prompted the Congress party to petition the election commission to act against this violation of election laws.\nBut nothing has deterred Modi from using inflammatory, Islamophobic language to demonise Muslims. He has even said his target of winning 400 seats is to prevent Congress from reviving Article 370 and putting the “Babri lock” on the Ram temple. Declaring “India is at a crucial juncture in history”, he has said the choice is between ‘vote jihad’ or ‘Ram Rajya’. He went further to say, “In Pakistan, terrorists are threatening jihad against India, and here the Congress people have also declared to ‘vote jihad’ against Modi, asking people of a particular religion to unite and vote against Modi.”\nAlong with Muslim-bashing,Pakistantoo has been targeted by Modi’s incendiary rhetoric. He has contrasted his muscular approach in dealing with terrorism allegedly emanating from Pakistan with the infirm response of his predecessors. “Earlier, weak governments used to send dossiers to Pakistan after terror attacks, but we hit terrorists in their homes” — a reference to India’s air strikes on Balakot in 2019. Describing his government’s “new India policy of looking an adversary in the eye and speaking the truth rather than resorting to stealth,” he has warned of launching cross-border strikes in response to terror attacks on India. He has also ridiculed Pakistan by saying “a supplier of terrorism is now struggling for flour”.\nThis makes the outlook for Pakistan-India relations a troubled one if Modi returns to power. Some may dismiss Modi’s Pakistan-bashing as election politics, but words have consequences. Moreover, anti-Pakistan and anti-Muslim themes are a part of his and the BJP’s deeply held beliefs. This may not preclude some form of post-election India-Pakistan re-engagement, but it is unlikely in the near term to lead to any significant movement toward normalisation of ties."}]}

The unintended consequences of American policies were laid bare by the outcome of the recentmeetingbetween Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing.\nThis was Putin’s first overseas visit after he secured a fifth term as president. It took place against the backdrop of tough US warnings to China not to support Russia’s war effort in Ukraine, where Russian forces are reported to be advancing in an offensive in the northeast. Washington imposed sanctions earlier this month on several Chinese companies for allegedly supplying Russia with components for military use. This happened immediately after Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to Beijing, where he raised US concerns about China’s military dealings with Russia. This met with a sharp response from Chinese officials, who dismissed US accusations as “groundless”. Foreign Minister Wang Yi shot back, saying “China is neither the creator of the Ukraine crisis nor a party to it”.\nSubsequently, the Biden administration significantly raised tariffs on Chinese imports including electric vehicles, computer chips and medical products in a bid to woo blue-collar voters in America’s swing states, where the president is trailing his rival, Donald Trump. This added to a growing stream of US trade restrictions, which Beijing sees as aimed at containing China and thwarting its economic progress. Predictably, the latest curbs provoked a furious response from Chinese officials.\nThe wide-ranging joint statement issued during Putin’s visit directed strong words at the US. It accused Washington of following a policy of “dual containment” towards China and Russia and engaging in “hegemonic behaviour.” “The United States,” it said “still thinks in terms of the Cold War and is guided by the logic of bloc confrontation putting the security of ‘narrow groups’ above regional security and stability, which creates a security threat for all countries in the region.” The statement criticised America’s Indo-Pacific strategy and also denounced US missile deployments around the world that “pose a direct security threat to China and Russia”. Both pledged to counter America’s “destructive and hostile course” that they cast as undermining global peace and stability.\nChina and Russia have a common interest to resist US pressure but ties have limits.\nThe lengthy, comprehensive statement also listed the steps the two countries planned to take to solidify military ties and scale up economic relations while identifying other areas of cooperation for a “new era of partnership”. Both restated support for the other’s core interest. Russia reiterated its recognition of Taiwan as an “inalienable” part of China. China joined the Russiancritique of Nato activitiesin Europe. The statement also expressed their shared view on North Korea. Conspicuous by its absence was any Chinese endorsement of Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine.\nIn fact, China has adopted a ‘neutral’ position on the Ukraine conflict and offered to be a mediator in the crisis. From the outset, it had misgivings about Russia’s 2022 invasion. It often communicated these to Moscow and occasionally even publicly voiced them in a veiled manner. In the meeting between Xi and Putin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in 2022, the Chinese leader conveyed his reservations over escalation of the Ukraine crisis. Putin later acknowledged that “concerns and questions” were raised by the Chinese president. China’s repeated calls for a ceasefire and negotiations for a political solution reflects its strong preference for a speedy conclusion to the war. Last year, it also offered a 12-point plan for a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.\nBut hostile US actions and its trade and tech war with China have only aligned Beijing more closely with Russia and relegated differences with Moscow on Ukraine and other issues to the background. To be sure, China-Russia interests do not converge on many issues especially as China, as a rising global power, has nothing to gain by upending or destabilising the international system, while Russia has few compunctions to act responsibly. Moreover, they confront different challenges and have different stakes in global stability.\nUS threats of sanctions against Chinese banks and companies engaged in transactions that can aid Russia’s military machine have apparently made Beijing somewhat cautious. Nevertheless, Beijing has responded strongly to US allegations that it is supporting Putin’s war by supplying critical weapon components. It has countered these charges by insisting it is not supplying lethal arms and it “prudently handles the export of dual-use items in accordance with laws and regulations”. Mounting US pressure on this count has led Beijing to rebuff Washington by strengthening its military relations with Russia. Their deepening strategic cooperation has in turn perturbed Western nations.\nUneasy China may be with Putin’s Ukraine adventure, but what the war has done is to significantly deepen its economic ties with Russia and tied the economies of the two countries more closely. For Russia, facing Western economic sanctions, growing economic relations with China have enabled it to mitigate the impact of Western financial and trade curbs. In 2023, two-way trade between them reached a record high of $240 billion. The bulk of this trade is conducted in rubles and renminbi.\nLast year, Russia also became China’s top source ofoil supply, overtaking Saudi Arabia, providing discounted, cheaper crude. China is Russia’s biggest trading partner, exporting a range of products from cars and machinery to electronics.\nBoth countries face pressure and sanctions — on different grounds — from the US in an increasingly coercive and punitive approach, even if Western actions against Russia are of a different order. This has created a greater incentive and common interest for China and Russia to join forces to resist US pressure. While there will be limits to the Sino-Russian relationship over time because the interests of the two countries don’t converge on many counts, for now, US policies have ensured they will maintain a close alignment to counter Washington’s pressure."}]}

But it has also been an enormous challenge. In fact, the tyranny of geography has imposed heavy burdens on Pakistan and its people.\nThe country’s location in a volatile neighbourhood and the headwinds of global geopolitics driven by big power interests have long placed Pakistan in the crosshairs of many regional storms and facing the multidimensional fallout of wars and internal strife in Afghanistan.\nInsecure borders, including contested ones, a hostile neighbour and turmoil in other neighbouring countries urged Pakistan to evolve defence strategies and security policies to avoid a two-front situation. Its nightmare scenario is having to simultaneously deal with more than one hot front. Today, the country hastroubled relationswith three of its neighbours andhot borderswith at least two of them. With a third country, there are unresolved problems of border management.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that the current state of strained relations with Afghanistan needs to be assessed. Stable ties with Kabul are Pakistan’s strategic compulsion. But relations have steadily deteriorated over the past 18 months and hit a new low. This is contrary to expectations of policymakers that the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 would help Pakistan secure its western border. Instead, there was a marked escalation in border tensions and terrorist attacks targeting Pakistan’s security forces. Asurge in violent activitiesby the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) from their safe havens in Afghanistan posed increasing threats to Pakistan’s security.\nThis was not surprising as the “TTP benefited the most of all the foreign extremist groups in Afghanistan from the Taliban takeover”, according to successive reports by the UN Security Council’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team. This echoed Pakistan’s assessment that Kabul’s unwillingness to act against the TTP and its regrouping in Afghanistan after the Taliban’s assumption of power presented a mounting threat to Pakistan’s security.Cross-border attacksescalated following thebreakdownin November 2022 of the ceasefirebrokeredby the Afghan Taliban between Pakistani authorities and the TTP. The short-lived ceasefire was an ill-thought and futile attempt by the Pakistani authorities to end the armed group’s 14-year war on Pakistan. The outlawed group never observed the truce, only leveraged it to expand its reach in Pakistan.\nPakistan needs to craft a more nuanced carrot-and-stick policy to deal with Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers.\nPakistan’s efforts to persuade Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers over the past two years to take action against the TTP yielded little. In countless rounds of talks, Pakistani officials urged Kabul to disarm the TTP, detain its leaders and rein in its violent activities. Taliban leaders offered assurances, asking for time, but did nothing. This produced growing frustration in Islamabad, especially as the spike in terrorist activities led to a significant rise in casualties among security personnel. Increasingly, military and government leaders publicly assailed Kabul andvoiced concernsover “the safe havens and liberty of action available to the TTP in Afghanistan”. Taliban leaders were asked to choose between Pakistan and the TTP and served notice that their lack of response would force Islamabad’s hand.\n\nThe latest expression of official exasperation with Kabul came in a press conference last week by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi. HoldingTTP responsiblefor the Marchattack on Chinese workersin Bisham, he said it had orchestrated this from Afghanistan as a “flagship project” supported by “enemy intelligence agencies”. He demanded Kabul should arrest the terrorists behind the attack, prosecute them or hand them over to Pakistan. Despite Islamabad’s urgings, he said, the Taliban had not taken measures to prevent militants from launching attacks from their Afghan sanctuaries. Last Thursday, a corps commanders conference also expressed serious concern over “continuous cross-border terrorist attacks” from Afghan soil, adding that “hostile foreign actors were using Afghanistan” to target security personnel and civilians in Pakistan.\nLast fall, with its patience exhausted, Islamabadtoughened its policytowards Afghanistan. Since then, it has taken several actions to raise the costs for the Taliban of its non-cooperation on TTP. Pakistan’s coercive approach towards Kabul has had four elements. One, it hasconducted air strikeson hideouts of the militant group in Afghanistan, most recently in April. In a departure from the past, when undeclared kinetic actions were undertaken, this time Islamabad announced Pakistan had carried out air strikes against militant sanctuaries. This met with a toughly worded response from Kabul and border tensions. But Islamabad warned such actions would continue unless the Taliban changed course.\nThe second element of coercive policy were restrictions on transit trade, which involved the ban imposed last October on a number of items that could be imported by Afghanistan via Pakistan. While the action aimed to curb smuggling, it also served a political purpose — to ratchet up pressure on Kabul. The message was not lost on the Taliban, who accused Pakistan of politicising trade. Later. some restrictions were eased as a ‘carrot’ to influence Taliban behaviour.\nThe third element of the ‘stick’ approach wasexpulsionof around 700,000 undocumented Afghans residing in Pakistan, also announced last fall. This has been implemented with well over half a million Afghans repatriated to Afghanistan. Asecond phaselooms with the decision to deport around 600,000 Afghans holding citizen cards issued by Pakistan a few years back.\n\nThe fourth element of Pakistan’s coercive policy involves regular public denunciations of Kabul’s failure to stop cross-border attacks. For example, ISPR has frequently said. “The Afghan interim government is not only arming terrorists but also providing a safe haven for terrorist organisations involved in terrorism in Pakistan.” Ministers have similarly chastised Kabul.\nThe question then is whether this coercive approach has yielded results. From the persisting TTP attacks it does not appear so. Nor does the interior minister’s statements indicate change in the Taliban’s behaviour. The vexing policy dilemma for Pakistan is that it cannot afford a rupture in relations with Afghanistan, especially because of its other troubled borders. It therefore needs to acknowledge that coercion alone will not deliver the outcome it wants. Instead, it will have to craft a more nuanced and calibrated carrot-and-stick approach.\nBoth incentives and disincentives have to be employed. Islamabad should also work with other neighbours of Afghanistan, especially China, on a coordinated regional strategy to persuade the Taliban to shift course."}]}

In aclosely fought election, the Congress party’s INDIA alliance made an unexpectedly strong showing. This left BJP short of a majority to form a government on its own and broke the myth of Modi’s invincibility.\nNevertheless, Modi cobbled together a majority with alliance partners to govern, but with a diminished mandate. He will head a coalition government and have to rely on wily and ficklepolitical alliesto survive in power. For a man unused to sharing power, dealing with coalition politics and regional kingmakers will be uncharted territory, as well as contending with a powerful opposition.\n\nThis challenging scenario will oblige Modi 3.0 to focus a great deal of attention on domestic political consolidation. That will likely see him double down on his Hindutva ideology to reinforce his Hindu base, especially as the BJP was mostly unable to make inroads beyond its strongholds. Modi and BJP’s viciousanti-Muslim rhetoricduring the election campaign was more than just a tool of political strategy. It reflected party ideology and its deep-seated belief about the place of Muslims in ‘Hindu India’.\nIts hard-line policy towards Muslims is therefore likely to continue. Coalition partners are unlikely to restrain the BJP in that regard. To consolidate its Hindu constituency, the Modi government might pursue with even greater vigour its Hindutva agenda, involving actions such as a uniform civil code, ending reservations for Muslims, and seizingmosques in Varanasiand Mathura to claim them as old temples. All these are part of its manifesto.\nRelated to this was the BJP’s resort toPakistan-bashingin the election campaign. Modi compared his muscular response to cross-border terrorism with the infirm approach of his predecessors, saying he will continue to “hit terrorists in their homes” (“Hum ghar me ghus ke marenge“).His reference was to theair strikeshe ordered on Balakot in February 2019 after a terrorist attack in Pulwama in occupied Kashmir. BJP leaders’ other pronouncements on Pakistan were equally belligerent and offensive. This too was part of the party’s strategy to appeal to its Hindu support base, having determined that the Pulwama episode had helped it reap rich electoral dividends in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.\nAgain, anti-Pakistan tirades were not just election politics but indicative of the combative approach the BJP government may adopt towards Islamabad. Moreover, domestic political problems will create the temptation to ramp up anti-Pakistan rhetoric and for Modi to further harden his Pakistan policy.\n\nThese factors do not create a propitious climate for India-Pakistan re-engagement and, in fact, limit the scope for a thaw in the frosty relationship. The path to normalisation of ties is in any case strewn with formidable difficulties. The diplomatic deadlock between the two neighbours has remained unbroken for the past five years.\nRelations were ruptured when Indiaillegally annexedJammu and Kashmir in August 2019, bifurcated it, and absorbed it into the Indian Union in brazen violation of UN Security Council resolutions. Formal dialogue was suspended by Delhi years earlier. And in February 2019, in the wake of the Pulwama crisis, India slapped200 per cent customs dutyon Pakistani imports in a bid to restrict trade with Pakistan. Islamabad’s response to Delhi’s Kashmir action was to halt trade altogether and downgrade diplomatic relations by recalling its high commissioner.\nThere are many obstacles to a thaw in the frosty India-Pakistan relationship.\nHowever, backchannel communication between them led in February 2021 to recommitment by both sides to observe aceasefire on the Line of Controlin Kashmir in accordance with a 2003 understanding. This was a significant development following the dangerous confrontation between the two countries in February 2019, when Indian air strikes in Pakistani territory pushed the two countries to the brink of conflict. Agreement on an LoC truce marked a much-needed de-escalation of tensions. The ceasefire has since mostly held. But expectations that this temporary thaw would pave the way for the resumption of a peace process did not materialise.\nThe diplomatic impasse has since persisted, with verbal clashes punctuating tense relations. Islamabad made the resumption of dialogue contingent upon India rescinding its August 2019 action. Delhi showed no interest in resuming talks, saying that Kashmir was off the negotiating table.\n\nInstead, it continued its repressive policy and human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. Despite Pakistan’s protests, India proceeded in the next three years to undertake a slew of sweeping legal, demographic, and electoral changes in occupied Kashmir aimed at disempowering Kashmiri Muslims. This further vitiated the climate and left ties more fraught.\nIn May 2023, foreign ministerBilawal Bhutto-Zardari visited Indiato attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. But the opportunity for any re-engagement proved elusive as no bilateral meeting took place. Instead, the foreign ministers of the two countriestraded stinging barbs, while India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar,accusedBilawal of being the “spokesperson of a terrorism industry”.\nMeanwhile, another irritant was added last year to the long list of disputes between the two countries when India threatened to unilaterally modify theIndus Waters Treaty’s disputesettlement provisions. It also boycotted a court of arbitration hearing at the Hague on Indian hydroelectric projects on the Chenab and Jhelum rivers disputed by water-stressed Pakistan. The 1960 treaty has for over six decades survived wars, confrontations and tensions between the two countries, but Delhi’s stance put at stake the fate of this vital treaty that governs the sharing and management of trans-border rivers.\nAgainst this fraught backdrop, the prospects for any normalisation of relations appear slim. There is certainly the need for a working relationship and regular communication — even by a back channel — to manage tensions. Norma­li­sa­tion of ties, however, has to be on a reciprocal and mutually beneficial basis.\nFor now, Delhi’s well-known terms for re-engagement — minus settlement of disputes — Modi’s hostile stance on Pakistan, and BJP leaders’ threats to seize Azad Kashmir, hold out little hope for any forward movement in bilateral ties."}]}

In Britain, Nigel Farage’s Reform party is expected to make gains in next month’s elections at the expense of the Conservative party.\nThe resurgence of the far right in the West comes at a time when democracy is already under threat across the world. Democratic regression is now a worldwide phenomenon. Democratic backsliding has been pervasive in countries facing challenges from polarisation, intolerance, anti-minority sentiment and toxic politics. This global trend has been recorded by many international organisations.\nIn its annualDemocracy Report 2024, the Swedish V-Dem Institute finds democracy has declined in almost all regions of the world with “the wave of autocratisation” becoming more pronounced. Its research shows a rollback of democratic rights and institutions. It says the level of democracy enjoyed by citizens worldwide is down to levels last seen in 1985 — almost 40 years ago. According to the report 71pc of the world’s population — 5.7 billion people — live in autocracies — an increase from 48pc 10 years ago.\nSimilarly, the latest edition of theGlobal State of Democracy 2023 reportby the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance sees democracies continuing to contract globally with erosion in checks and balances and constitutional freedoms in nominally democratic states. It finds that for six consecutive years “more countries experienced net declines in democratic processes than net improvements”.\nLike many other countries Pakistan has also seen democratic regression in recent years.\nDemocratic weakening is also the finding by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which conducts an annual survey of the health of democracy in 165 countries, assessing them across five measures. Itsreport, published earlier this year, says conflict and polarisation have driven a new low for global democracy. Its democracy index shows less than 8pc of the world’s population now reside in full democracies, and that 39pc are under authoritarian rule — up from 37pc in 2022. It designates Pakistan as a country under authoritarian rule, downgraded from the previous year when it was classified as a hybrid democracy. The report classifies India and America as flawed democracies. It finds 37pc of people living in a flawed democracy and 15pc in hybrid regimes.\n\nThe rise of the far right or ultra-nationalist populist leaders has much to do with democratic reversals. In countries witnessing this phenomenon elected leaders have acted with impunity to erode civil liberties, curb freedom of expression, suppress dissent, persecute minority groups and undermine any check-and-balance system that holds governments to account. They have shown disregard for democratic institutions and norms, engaged in authoritarian conduct and used hyper-nationalism to rally support, orchestrating anti-minority sentiment that often triggered violence. This has turned their political systems into illiberal or flawed democracies and deeply divided their societies.\nIn a recentop-edin theFinancial Times, Gideon Rachman makes a distinction between the far right and the right, which is helpful to keep in mind. The dividing line is their attitudes to democracy. He writes, “If a political leader refuses to accept the results of an election and wants to smash the ‘deep state’ (in reality, the state itself), then he or she is clearly on the far right.” But leaders who pursue reactionary, even racist policies (he includes Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni) but “within the framework of democratic politics and the rule of law”, cannot be regarded as far right. Sometimes, he argues, the line between a new form of authoritarian conservatism and the far right becomes “blurry.”\nThe global trend of democratic regression in the last decade or more raises the question of the underlying factors responsible for this and for the rise of far-right populist leaders. This cannot be attributed to any uniform set of reasons as each country’s case is different with distinct factors shaping its political trajectory.\nSome common features can still be identified although this is not an exhaustive list. They include the failure of traditional political parties and their policies to meet heightened public expectations, growing disconnect between political elites and the people, poor governance, increasing inequality, lack of responsiveness by institutions to public concerns, political polarisation, as well as economic and social discontent spawned by globalisation and the cost-of-living crisis. Many analysts ascribe the far right’s surge in Europe to public discontent with soaring inflation, fallout of the war in Ukraine, anti-immigrant sentiment and the cost of green policies.\nPakistan too has seen democratic decline, but for reasons different from those challenging de­­mocracy elsewhere. The2018 electionled to a form of hybrid democracy that increasingly shif­ted the civil-military power balance and gave way to a greater establishment role in governance, the political system and even economic management. This has been accompanied by po­­larised politics and an unbroken political deadlock that has marginalised parliament and ruled out resolution of disputes by political means.\nWhile efforts to curtail the freedom of expression have been resisted, the media is still subject to ‘informal’ controls. Meanwhile, the opposition continues to facecoercive actions. This makes the outlook for democracy in Pakistan as cloudy as it is in other parts of the world."}]}

He also indicated that its statehood would be restored.\nMeanwhile, the Election Commission of India announced that updated electoral rolls for J&K would be published on Aug 20. To understand the significance of this development and what the BJP government’s motives and intentions are, it is necessary to rewind and recall what happened five years ago and thereafter.\nEver since Indiaillegally annexed J&Kin 2019 by abrogating Article 370 of its constitution, which gave the state special status, it has tried to convey the impression that the situation there was normalising. Aug 5, 2019, had, in fact, opened a new chapter in the tortured history of the occupied territory.\n\nThe bifurcation of the state and its absorption in the Indian union was inbrazen violationof UN Security Council resolutions and was condemned throughout the state. Aprolonged lockdownand communication blackout followed, the military siege tightened, public assembly was banned, the press silenced and Kashmiri leaders jailed, including pro-Delhi politicians, to prevent a popular upsurge against the move, which robbed the Kashmiri people of virtually all their rights.\nThe Modi government’s claim that, over time, normalcy and stability had returned to Kashmir, was belied by continuing repression and human right violations,curbs on political activities, crackdown on the media, jailing of journalists, and induction of additional troops into what was already the world’s most militarised region. Leaders of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) continued to languish in jail or house detention.\nModi’s earlier efforts to hold legislative elections by enticing pro-Indian political leaders to participate came to naught. In June 2021, he invited these leaders to a round table conference on Kashmir. The aim was to consolidate the 2019 action by persuading select politicians to rejoin a revived political process and create a facade of ‘normality’. But even handpicked Kashmiri leaders rejected the government’s controversial delimitation move and, instead, demanded restoration of J&K’s statehood. The meeting ended in failure.\nPeople of occupied Kashmir will always find a way to say no to India.\nIn May 2022, India’s Delimitation Commission carved out new electoral constituencies in J&K that aimed to disempower the Muslim population. The delimitation plan handed Jammu six more seats in the 90-member J&K Assembly, while Kashmir was given only one more. Under this plan, Jammu’s representation went to 43 seats, leaving Kashmir with 47. This, despite the fact that, according to the 2011 census, the Kashmir Valley’s population was seven million, while Jammu’s was 5.3m. Delhi’s move to recast the electoral map was rejected across Kashmir. APHC leaders denounced it while pro-Delhi Kashmiri politicians called the plan unacceptable as it sought to alter Kashmir’s demography and aimed to turn the Muslim majority into a minority.\nThe post-2019 period saw almost every aspect of life for Muslims in occupied J&K come under assault by the BJP government. A series of steps — administrative, demographic, electoral — were taken to disempower and disenfranchise Kashmiris and alter the Muslim identity of Kashmir.\nSeveral actions mimicked Israeli settler policies in occupied Palestine. Demographic changes involved new domicile rules, with millions of so-called domicile certificates issued to non-Kashmiri outsiders, who became eligible after abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A of the constitution. Voting rights were also given to non-residents. Properties were confiscated and newland laws introduced to enable land to be seized from locals and transferred to outsiders.\nIn 2022, BJP authorities seized the J&K Waqf Board and all its properties across the region. This marked a drive to take control of all prominent places of religious significance for Muslims in the occupied territory, including shrines. Religious leaders and Islamic scholars were arrested and prayers barred in many mosques across Kashmir. These and other measures sought tosystematically erode Kashmiri religious identity and culture.\n\nThe announcement about polls in J&K comes against this grim backdrop of Delhi’s use of force and fraud to marginalise Kashmiri Muslims and set the stage for assembly elections, designed to ‘endorse’ and legitimise its 2019 action. The government islegally obligedto hold polls by Sept 30, 2024, by the supreme court verdict of December 2023, which upheld the abrogation of Article 370 as ‘constitutional’. The last assembly elections were held in 2014.\nApart from having to comply with the supreme court order, the Modi government has read the higher turnout in the Lok Sabha elections in J&K as a return to normalcy. Turnout in the three Lok Sabha constituencies in Kashmir certainly went up compared to the past, although in Srinagar, two-thirds of voters didn’t cast their ballot. Still, the higher turnout was disingenuously cast by BJP leaders as ‘vindication’ of the abrogation of Article 370.\nThis was contrary to reality, which was so strongly evidenced by the election of Abdul Rasheed Sheikh from Baramulla. A fierce opponent of abrogation, he won from jail, being incarcerated on terrorism charges, defeating former chief minister Omar Abdullah. His campaign was run on the slogan “Jail ka badla vote se leinge” (Voting will avenge the jailing). The support he drew across the board, especially from youth, reflected the depth of Kashmiri anger with Delhi in what was widely seen in the Valley as a vote against India.\nThere are some indications that many Kashmiris may want to use the vote in the assembly elections to convey their discontent and rejection of Delhi’s policies. This could be a departure from the past, when they boycotted polls as a sham process under occupation. With other avenues to voice their demands closed, the vote may become a vehicle of protest against Delhi.\nAlthough it is too early to say how this will play out, for now many Kashmiri residents are quoted in news reports as saying that voting, far from endorsing India or its policies, would be a way to register their dissent and resistance. The question, then, is if Delhi sees an electoral upsurge of resistance, would it still hold assembly elections?\nWhat is beyond doubt is that the people of occupied Kashmir will reject any regime foisted on them and continue, one way or another, to express their aspiration for freedom from Indian occupation."}]}

It also confronts a surge in security threats. How has the government managed so far to deal with these multiple fronts? Does it have a firm grip on the political, economic and security situation?\nDealing with PTI was never going to be easy. But it was a test of the government’s political management skills to engage the opposition’s parliamentary members in a way that minimised frequent disruptions of proceedings. However, with the party continuing to be the target of coercive actions by the authorities and their leader and activists in jail, PTI lawmakers have been in no mood to cease theirprotestsin parliament and outside.\nDespite a fleeting pause when the prime minister offered talks to the opposition — a move that was dead on arrival in the current fraught climate — there have been unending, bitter government-opposition clashes in the National Assembly. It has involved rejection by PTI lawmakers of the budget — as “anti-people” — as well as the government’s other policy measures including its latest counterterrorism plan. Government ministers have also been lashing out at PTI in and out of the House. But neither has secured the upper hand in this confrontation. Instead, both have reached a virtual dead end in trying to prevail on the other. A tense and disorderly stalemate persists.\nA ‘normalised’relationshipbetween the federal government and the PTI-run provincial government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is especially consequential for national stability. Issues concerning allocation of financial resources from the centre, adequate power supply and postings of officials remain a bone of contention between them. They need to be resolved for a proper working relationship to be established. Smooth working relations are also necessary for the robust execution of the federal government’s counterterrorism campaign as its main theatre of operations is obviously in KP.\nGovernments always have more to lose from confrontational politics. Certainly, it has distracted the PML-N-led coalition from greater focus on governance. It has laid bare a style of leadership evidenced by the prime minister’s dealings with allies, in which political engagement or negotiations are left to others. This reinforces his long-standing image as someone more comfortable being an administrator rather than a political leader; more at ease with bureaucrats than with politicians who he has to negotiate with. His not-so-frequent appearances in parliament also testify to this, which discourages ministers from showing up. This once prompted the elder Sharif, president of PML-N, to say the Shehbaz government should free itself from “bureaucratic influence”.\nThe budget was an example of how to reward the elite and punish everyone else.\nLack of consultation has emerged as a major grievance with the government by its principal political ally, the PPP. Although this complaint surfaced publicly at budget time, PPP leaders say it extends to the government’s overall functioning and lack of structured and sustained consultation. It prompted PPP legislators to sharply criticise the budget and call it “directionless”. Initially, the PPP threatened to boycott the budget session. Its lawmakers only agreed to participate after assurances by senior government leaders. Even so, PPP MNAs did not pull any punches in assailing budget proposals.\nThe Senate Standing Committee on Finance, chaired by a PPP senator, went so far as to call the budget against the national interest and in its report to the House called for withdrawal of several proposed measures. In his speech, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also took aim at budget proposals. Significantly he claimed the government had not fulfilled its commitment under the PML-N-PPP agreement, forged at the time of government formation, to consult his party on the budget and related decisions.\nDespite its misgivings, the PPP voted for the budget. But not before some changes to the finance bill, although this was also in response to demands by the business community. In any case, the whole episode underlined fitful management by the government of its relations with an ally without whose support it cannot survive in office. Of course, some of the PPP’s complaints reflect political posturing to bargain for more from the government, such as its power-sharing demands in the Punjab government. Nevertheless, it suggests this would remain an uneasy and unpredictable relationship, especially as the government has preferred an ad hoc approach to managing it rather than an institutionalised one.\nThe budget was the first major test for the Shehbaz government. It evoked criticism across the board, from political parties, business community, media and the public at large. Having to meet IMF conditionalities to qualify for a new larger Fund loan programme provided the government no choice but to take painful adjustment measures. But the budget was an example of how to reward the elite and punish everyone else.\nThe Pakistan Business Council had this to say: “Sacred cowswill graze freely while the golden geese will be cooked.” Certainly, placing the burden of additional taxation on the salaried middle class marked a failure to equitably distribute the pain of adjustment, especially in view of the budget’s pro-elite measures including salary increases for civil servants. This deepened public discontent at a time of mounting economic hardship, especially as increasing disruptions in power supply worsened people’s plight at the peak of summer.\nThe government’s lack of a communication strategy to explain budget measures and how they would extricate the country from the economic crisis contributed to public frustration. In fact, the government’s weak communication on other counts too has denuded it of the ability to demonstrate it is running the affairs of state purposively. Its response to the deteriorating security situation came on the heels of the publicexpression of concernby a senior Chinese official visiting Pakistan. Its initial announcement of a new operation necessitated several later explanations indicating a lack of clarity.\nFour months may be too short a time to judge a government’s performance but it is the initial period that sets the tone and direction — and when the moment has to be seized. So far, the government’s performance has been underwhelming. How much the prevailing dyarchical political system has contributed to this is another question."}]}

In countries both in the West and East, the electorate’s yearning for change has been evident. So has strong anti-incumbency sentiment that has dealt heavy blows to ruling parties. Driving this are fraught economic conditions and the cost-of-living crisis sweeping the world. Discontent in a landscape of economic inequality has motivated voters to punish incumbents. Another common aspect is the anti-establishment vote, with people holding establishment leaders responsible for the unedifying state of affairs in their country.\nMany countries that have held elections are deeply polarised and whose politics has become increasingly fractured and volatile. The political system is seen not to deliver at a time of heightened public expectations, magnified by the social media. In several cases, electoral mandates have not matched the popular vote, with the first-past-the-post system disproportionately rewarding the election winner and obscuring underlying political realities. There are, of course, many differences among these countries reflecting their specific circumstances and political trajectories. The desire for change, for example, has led to different outcomes in different countries but the common trends hold even if their political expressions vary.\nTheelection in Francehas been a political roller coaster, while exhibiting several common features described above. Buoyed by its strong showing in the European Parliament elections, Marine Le Pen’s far right party swept the first round of the French poll. The incumbent President Emmanuel Macron’s party came third in an atmosphere of popular disenchantment. Calling a snap poll seemed to backfire as fears grew of the country’s throwback to the time of the Vichy regime when France was ruled by the far right during the Second World War. Those fears galvanised voters who in the run-off election produced an outcome that surprised pollsters. A newly assembled left-wing alliance and Macron’s centrist party forged expedient, tactical arrangements to block the victory of Le Pen’s National Rally party. The result put the left-wing alliance Nouveau Front Populaire in first place, Macron’s party second and NR third. However, the fractured vote produced a hung parliament, with no party winning a majority. This has left France facing a prolonged period of political instability, even paralysis.The Economistwarned of a crisis of governability. The far right’s advance has been halted for now. But the prospect of turmoil in a polarised and economically troubled country could well create the conditions for the far right’s comeback.\nInIran, voters’ longing for change enabled the election of the first reformist president in over 20 years. Masoud Pezeshkian’s victory over a hard-line rival in the run-off poll marked a dramatic break with the past as voters turned out to support a man who pledged change in his country’s domestic and foreign policies. Pezeshkian promised to re-engage with the West and resume the nuclear dialogue in order to secure an easing of the sanctions that have inflicted so much hardship on the Iranian people. He also promised to relax social restrictions imposed by previous hard-line governments, indicating there may be no return to the repressive policies of the past.\nAnti-incumbency sentiment and economic hardship have been factors in shaping voters’ choices.\nWhile Pezeshkian’s electoral victory was owed to enthusiastic voters it was also because he was allowed to run by the political/ religious establishment, which had disqualified reformist candidates in the past and seen its legitimacy erode over the years as the economy deteriorated. Its decision was driven by fear of the return of ultra conservatives represented, among others, by the Paydari, a hard-line political group, whose members are called “super revolutionaries” in Iran. It supported Pezeshkian’s rival Saeed Jalili. The group opposes in principle any opening to the West and has hard-line views on other issues. It was rumoured that the Paydari, who backed Jalili, had their own plans on the future leadership, which would have influenced succession to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. These power dynamics created an enabling environment for the Iranian electorate to vote for change in the election.\nTheIndian electionalso saw anti-incumbency sentiment robbing Narendra Modi’s BJP of a majority. Although he was re-elected prime minister, his use of the Hindutva card as well as claims he had delivered a better economic future to India’s underprivileged were rejected by voters, as were his high-handed ruling methods. The Congress party-led opposition alliance did much better than pollsters predicted and managed to capitalise on anti-incumbency dissatisfaction, especially with soaring inflation and rising unemployment. Like elections in other countries, voters in economic distress made their disenchantment with the status quo evident by denying the BJP a majority and forcing it to rely on allies to stay in power. The BJP still got 240 seats but with just 36 per cent of the popular vote. The polarisation that India has seen in the past decade looks set to continue.\nElections in Britain saw a stronger anti-incumbency wave with the Labour Party inflicting a crushing defeat on the Conservative Party, in its worst-ever electoral performance. The Tory party’s inept and scandal-ridden 14 years in power convinced voters it was time for a change especially as its economic management at a time of austerity evoked widespread public anger as it left people much worse off. Sweeping cuts in public services also deepened public discontent. Brexit divided the country and to some extent the vote against the Tories also reflected a backlash against a decision many Britons disagreed with. The vote was motivated more by rage at the Tories than enthusiasm for Labour, which also saw its Muslim support dwindle over its Gaza stance. It lost four seats to pro-Palestinian independents. The Conservative Party vote was eroded by the far right represented by Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party, which polled 14pc of the popular vote. The Liberal Democrats trailed behind by polling only 12pc but taking 60 seats to just four won by Reform. This indicated how fragmented politics had become.\nThe interplay between anti-incumbency sentiment, popular desire for change, public frustration with deteriorating economic conditions and a fractured political system has been a common thread in elections this year in different countries. This suggests volatile electorates ahead especially as public disenchantment persists with their economic and political exclusion."}]}

This, at a time when the country needs political calm and stability to fix the economy. The decision announced just days after thestaff-level agreement with the IMFfor a larger, longer-duration loan programme suggests that the government either doesn’t understand the nexus between economic and political stability or chooses to overlook it in a state of panic.\nThe panic was obviously triggered byPTI’s legal victoryin the Supreme Court; by the verdict that the party was entitled to its share of reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies. In overturning the Election Commission and Peshawar High Court’s decisions, the apex court said PTI is a political party despite having lost its election symbol. This dealt a huge blow to the ruling coalition. With PTI poised to emerge as the single largest party in the National Assembly, and the government losing its two-thirds majority, the ruling party went into panic.\nPML-N leaders assailed the court judgement in unseemly language, intensifying tensions with the judiciary. They didn’t see the disconnect between attacking the court and, at the same time, approaching it for a review of its judgement and, later, on the ban issue. The Supreme Court has the final say on banning a party under the Constitution.\nThe ruling party seemed to fear that the SC verdict would also open up a Pandora’s box calling into question the election to the Senate and president, as the electoral college that elected them was constituted on legally flawed grounds in light of the expected redistribution of seats. Perhaps PML-N’s fears were accentuated by the prospect of the courts, which acquitted Khan in a number of key cases, eventually moving to order his release from prison, where he has been incarcerated for the past year. That may explain why PML-N spokesmen also declared the intention to initiate ‘high treason’ proceedings against Khan.\nThe country needs political calm to stabilise the economy, not escalation of tensions.\nThe government’s announcement about banning PTI evoked widespread condemnation by many political leaders, the media, lawyers and human rights groups. The grounds cited by government spokesmen were flimsy, involving charges that the judiciary had already thrown out. Legal experts were near unanimous in saying it would be next to impossible for the court to uphold such a controversial and legally dubious decision should a reference be made to it. Meanwhile the government moved the Supreme Court for a review of the reserved seats verdict.\nThese developments have escalated political tensions and left the country in a state of dangerous flux. Even if the government retreats from its decision in view of the intensely adverse reaction, it shows how insecure it is feeling, as well as its intolerant mindset. It has also laid bare the fact that the government has little support from across the political spectrum, although the PPP is going along with the decision while demurring on taking a clear public position.\nAfter the Supreme Court verdict, wisdom and political prudence demanded an effort by the government to hold a dialogue with the opposition to forge some kind of understanding on the way forward, especially in view of the economic challenge. PTI also had to show similar responsibility. Instead, the government wants to eliminate it from the political arena. If Pakistan’s past is any guide, it shows that outlawing political parties has never worked as they either live to fight another day or resurface under a new name. But history is a poor teacher in Pakistan, where political leaders keep repeating the same mistakes.\nThere are signs the government may bebacktracking on the ban, as it has been saying any final decision will be taken after consultations with political allies. PML-N leaders say they will first try to build a consensus, while the defence minister described the ban announcement as premature. But if the government decides to go ahead, it will run several risks. The most obvious is the legal one, given the strong possibility that the Supreme Court will not endorse such a ban. Considering it just recognised PTI as a political party, it is hardly likely to judge it to be acting in a manner prejudicial to the “sovereignty and integrity of Pakistan”.\nThe political risk is also high. Banning a national party, expected to be the biggest in parliament, will inevitably provoke turmoil, deepen polarisation, and force PTI towards agitation. The coalition government will be shorn of any democratic credentials as well as its legitimacy. The action will be opposed by political parties, civil society and the media, with international criticism likely to grow. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has described the intention to ban PTI as a “blow to democratic norms”. In fact, the government has already lost much credibility by its announcement and incurred a political cost even before doing anything. Words always have consequences.\nThen there is the economic risk. Implementing a tough IMF programme will be much more daunting in an environment marked by political confrontation, turbulence and uncertainty. Indeed, measures that entail economic hardship for people across the board require the widest possible political consensus for their effective implementation. Efforts to revive the economy and build investor confidence will be seriously threatened by the escalation of political tensions. An ailing economy can hardly be healed in fraught political conditions. International rating agencies have been quick to issue warnings in this regard. The latest Fitch report cautions that Pakistan’s economic recovery can be derailed by the ongoing political turmoil.\nFor all these reasons, the government’s plan to ban PTI is a serious misreading of what it can gain by doing so. The high-risk gamble also misreads the mood in the country. People are both weary and wary of more political conflict and confrontation that further vitiates the political atmosphere. Any such move will put at grave risk both the country’s political and economic stability as well as endanger Pakistan’s fragile democracy. Amid warnings of a constitutional breakdown, the government should desist from going down this path."}]}

Any expectation that a multilateral summit that Islamabad will host in October will help to melt the ice between Pakistan and India seems premature in view of the persisting diplomatic stalemate, which neither side has sought to overcome.\nAs rotational chair of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), Pakistan willconvenethe heads of government summit in around three months’ time. As part of the seven-member regional grouping, India has of course been invited. While it is too early to say whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi will participate, indications so far are that it is highly unlikely. There has been no development to suggest that either side sees this as an opportunity for bilateral re-engagement. Quite the opposite.\nSports is always a useful barometer to assess if a diplomatic thaw is on the anvil as it both reflects a softening in position and paves the way for an easing of tensions. But that front too offers little grounds for optimism. Although cricket diplomacy has played a part in the past to bring the two countries closer, this is no longer the case.\n\nPakistan is to host theICC Champions Trophybetween February and March 2025. The Indian media is already reporting, citing official sources, that due to “strained relations” between the two neighbours, the Indian cricket team will not travel to Pakistan. Instead, the Indian cricket board plans to ask ICC for India’s matches to be played in Dubai or Sri Lanka. For some years now, the Modi government has barred its cricket team from playing in Pakistan. Even though Pakistan’s team played in India in an international tournament in late 2023, the Indian team did not come to Pakistan for theAsia Cup, hosted by Pakistan last September.\nMore importantly, exchanges between the two countries after the Indian elections have been anything but encouraging. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s congratulatory message to Modi on his re-election elicited a terse response. The reply waswrapped in ‘security’ languageexpressing Modi’s commitment to “the security and safety” of Indian citizens. Although PML-N president Nawaz Sharif’s message of felicitation to Modi was cast in conciliatory terms, it elicited a similar, terse response with emphasis on security. Moreover, Pakistan was excluded from the list of regional leaders invited to Modi’s oath-taking ceremony. In 2014, Nawaz Sharif had attended Modi’s first inauguration.\n\nBut it was Modi’saccusations against Pakistanlast week that provided the clearest indicator of his stance. In a speech on the anniversary of the Kargil conflict, he said: “Pakistan has not learned anything from its history. It is trying to keep itself relevant with the help of terrorism and proxy war.” He also called Pakistan “masters of terror”. Earlier, Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar used the same old tired rhetoric in his first statement on assuming charge. Spelling out what future engagement with Islamabad would involve, he said: “We would want to find a solution to the issue of years-old cross-border terrorism.”\nProspects are bleak for resumption of any formal dialogue between Pakistan and India.\nA verbal clash between the foreign ministries of the two countries on occupied Kashmir followed in the wake of PM Sharif’s China visit in June. The Pakistan-China joint statement of June 8 had referred to the need to resolve all outstanding disputes in South Asia with the Chinese side reiterating its principled stand that “the Jammu and Kashmir dispute … should be peacefully resolved in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements”.\nThis prompted the Indian external affairs ministry spokesman to criticise the reference claiming it was “unwarranted” and that “the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Union territory of Ladakh have been, are and will always remain integral and inalienable parts of India”. Islamabad dismissed these remarks and reiterated that Kashmir was an internationally recognised disputed territory and Indian claims were “unfounded”.\nIt seems the Modi government’s preference is to maintain a strategic freeze on relations with Pakistan. It has shown no interest in resuming dialogue with Islamabad, apparently concluding that this hurts Pakistan, not India. Pakistan-bashing by BJP leaders during the election campaign reflected their animus towards Pakistan. Modi’s own statements were extremely provocative. At one point, he compared his muscular response to cross-border terrorism with the infirm approach of his predecessors, saying he will continue to “hit terrorists in their homes”. His reference was to the Indian airstrikes he ordered on Balakot in February 2019 after a terrorist attack in Pulwama in occupied Kashmir. This had led to a dangerous confrontation between the nuclear neighbours.\nIn recent weeks, there has been a virtual chorus in the Indian media about “foreign infiltrators” in J&K in the wake of a series of attacks on Indian security forces in Jammu. Several newspapers have referred to so-called “shadow militant outfits” linked to Pakistani militant groups that are carrying out a “proxy war”, with Jammu as the new theatre of operations.The Hinducalled it the “highest recorded militant footprint” in Jammu since 2005. This seems an orchestrated effort to externalise the problem in order to shield the government from blame for the deteriorating security situation. It is also designed to keep Pakistan under pressure. All this makes any chances of resumption of talks between India and Pakistan rather remote.\nIndia’s obdurate refusal to discuss the Kashmir dispute poses a major challenge for Pakistan. Even if talks were to resume down the road it would be impossible for Islamabad to have a formal dialogue minus Kashmir. Indeed, a ‘peace’ process which doesn’t include Kashmir will not go anywhere.\nThis is not a hard-line view but the dictate of law, principle and reality. As for reviving trade between the two countries this too presents challenges. While a constituency for expanding bilateral trade exists on both sides, Delhi has thus far, shown no interest in reviving economic ties. India imposed 200 per cent tariff on Pakistani imports following the Pulwama incident. Trade was formally suspended by Islamabad after India’s illegal annexation of Jammu and Kashmir on Aug 5, 2019. Since then, relations have been in deep freeze. In view of latest developments, there seems to be little prospect of the ice melting between the two countries."}]}

In a press conference he said Pakistan was engaged with China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE for debt rescheduling of around $12 billion. Longer repayment periods are being sought for loans of $4bn from China, $5bn from Saudi Arabia and $3bn from the UAE, which the country had secured for a year and now wants to delay repaying.\nHaving returned after talks in China, the finance minister did not say if Beijing had agreed and responded to questions on this by asserting that discussions were “very constructive”. The board meeting of the Fund on the bailout package is likely later this month. The minister made it clear that “between now and the IMF board meeting we have to ensure confirmation of external financing from friendly bilateral partners”. Subsequently in remarks released to the media, Prime MinisterShehbaz Sharif told the cabinet he hadwritten a letterto the Chinese government requesting ‘debt reprofiling’ for Pakistan.\nAlthough external support is essential in view of heavily indebted Pakistan’s urgent financing needs, the government should have gone about it more thoughtfully. This is so for several reasons. The most significant is that when such debt relief is sought from, say, China, a creditor of many countries in the Global South, it is best to do it discreetly and away from the glare of publicity. This is important so as not to place a friendly bilateral lender in an awkward position, not least because this has implications for its loans to other countries. Although the finance minister apparently made these comments in response to questions, it would have been prudent to have refrained from public comment when talks are in progress. The time to do that is when talks produce an outcome.\nIn any case seeking external support is necessary but not sufficient to fix the economy. It is a fire-fighting response that should be accompanied by and be part of the country’s own longer-term economic plan that involves resolving well-known, long-standing structural problems. But a visionless government has yet to frame or produce such a plan. Its economic strategy rests on little more than meeting the IMF’s conditionalities and securing debt rescheduling from bilateral donors. That is not an economic plan. This despite the government’s claims it is evolving a home-grown one — that too under the stewardship of some British economist. This reflects the prime minister’s fetish for foreign advisers and consultants, and his lack of confidence in the country’s vast pool of distinguished economists.\nPakistan is at risk of being reduced to a supplicant in its key bilateral relationships.\nA credible plan should address the country’s weak macroeconomic fundamentals, which persist and make any recovery fragile and unsustainable. Unless structural issues are addressed, the country will not escape from the vicious circle of anaemic growth, high deficits, heavy borrowing, growing indebtedness and soaring inflation. Failure to tackle them will make another crisis inevitable, need another bailout (the country is already in its 24th Fund programme) and yet more financial support from friendly countries, fatigued by Pakistan’s repeated requests. IMF programmes aim to stabilise the economy and create the conditions for economic recovery. But policies to grow the economy, promote investment and build business confidence are for the country to evolve, own and implement through a process of wide-ranging structural reforms.\nIndeed, if the country is seen to be undertaking major reforms it would make it easier to achieve the short-term goal of securing external support to tide over immediate financing difficulties. When other countries see Pakistan is doing what it can to help itself, they will be all the more willing to accede to its financing requests. Absent serious efforts at self-help bilateral lenders, however friendly, will think twice especially as the ‘beggar bowl’ approach will be perceived to have become an unshakeable habit. In his previous tenure, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly acknowledged that even friendly countries look at Pakistan as a country always ‘begging for money’. More recently, he claimed during an overseas visit that he had broken the begging bowl and the era of asking others for money is over. But that assertion flies in the face of reality.\nThe main thrust of his government’s economic policy is still to mobilise external resources from either multilateral or bilateral lenders. This increasingly puts the finance ministry in the lead to deal with the country’s key foreign relationships. It also means that the main thrust — or core goal — of foreign policy today has become trying to secure funds from friendly countries. This ignores or eclipses the country’s other foreign policy goals and interests. In fact, the lack of attention given to foreign policy beyond asking ‘friends’ for money and clumsy, ad hoc responses to international developments has become a distinguishing trait of this government. This isn’t only because the country has a part-time foreign minister, uninterested in foreign policy. It is also because the government has failed to acknowledge that in a rapidly changing and intensely competitive world it needs to focus on how to more effectively pursue Pakistan’s foreign policy interests.\nThis required in the first instance a broad review of the country’s foreign policy given the changing international environment, shifts in global geopolitics and strategic realignments taking place in the Middle East and beyond. That would have helped adjust policy to changing dynamics and reshaped diplomatic strategy to more efficiently pursue national goals. Such a review could also have involved a frank conversation between civilian and military officials on critical areas of foreign policy being handled by Rawalpindi. This may have improved civil-military coordination in these areas and offered an opportunity to government leaders to persuade the military leadership to see the foreign ministry as the country’s first line of defence and competent to handle issues on which it has been excluded in recent years.\nOf course, none of this has happened. With the country’s economic and foreign policy mainly focused on securing external financing and debt rollovers, Pakistan is at risk of being reduced to a supplicant in its principal bilateral relationships."}]}

Ten months of Israel’s brutal war on Gaza have already claimed 40,000 Palestinian lives, displaced two million people, and brought untold suffering to Gazans.\nIts assassination in quick succession of top Hamas leaderIsmail Haniyehin Iran, and senior Hezbollah commanderFuad Shukrin Lebanon, further raised the stakes in a dangerous escalation of regional tensions. The audacious targeted killing of Haniyeh, a former prime minister of Palestine, who was in Tehran to attend the inauguration of thenewly electedIranian president sent shockwaves throughout the Middle East. This came a day after an Israeli strike assassinated Shukr in Beirut.\nJust a week earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu undertook ahigh-profile trip to Washington, where he received enthusiastic bipartisan support. He met President Joe Biden, former president Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, all of whomreiteratedtheir unflinching commitment to Israel’s security. He received rapturous applause during his address to the joint session of Congress.\n\nThis emboldened Netanyahu to up his deadly game and order the two assassinations on his return, even if they were planned before. He also took advantage of a lame-duck Biden administration, which urged a ceasefire but did little to pressure Israel. Instead, the deployment of additional US warships andfighter aircraftto the Middle East on the heels of the killings indicated the ‘cover’ Washington sought to provide Israel and ‘legitimise’ rather than censure Israel’s brazen violations of international law. Ostensibly aimed at mitigating the risk of a broader conflict, it only exacerbated tensions in the Middle East.\nThese developments have driven the region to the brink of a wider conflagration, with Iran under mounting pressure to retaliate for Haniyeh’s assassination and violation of its territorial integrity and sovereignty. Its leaders have vowed to avenge the killing, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning of a harsh, punishing response. Iran’s newly elected President Masoud Pezeshkian has made it clear that Tehran does not wish to broaden the war and contribute to a bigger crisis, but Israel “will definitely receive a response for its crimes and insolence”. Meanwhile, Hassan Nasrallah, head of Hezbollah, declared that its conflict with Israel had entered a new phase and warned of a major retaliation in response to the assassination.\nTehran, however, is faced with a dilemma as it mulls an appropriate response to Israel. It knows further escalation and a widening of the war is exactly what Netanyahu wants, having tried — unsuccessfully — for years to goad Washington into joining Israel in an attack on Iran. It also has to consider that any significant military reprisal would rule out the possibility of détente with the West that Pezeshkian had pledged to pursue to secure sanctions relief.\nBut it cannot let Tel Aviv’s criminal action go unanswered and has to do more than just save face to re-establish deterrence. Its carefully calculated, limited military response to Israel’s bombing of the Iranian consulate in Damascus in April did not deter the Israelis from carrying out the Hamas leader’s assassination on Iranian soil.\n\nFor now, Iran’s focus is on diplomatic efforts to build a consensus at the regional and global level against Israel’s aggressive actions. Attempts by some Arab countries at Washington’s behest to dissuade Tehran to hold off a military response have not gone anywhere. Concerned about an “imminent” Iranian attack on Israel, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was urging all parties to refrain from escalation and “take steps to ease tensions”. Although the US called for a ceasefire, the Biden administration had nothing to say about the fact that the Israelis killed the man who was negotiating with them for a ceasefire and hostage and detainees release deal.\nThis dealt a heavy blow to the talks brokered by the US, Qatar and Egypt. It again exposed Netanyahu’s lack of interest in a peace deal and intent to prolong the war. Washington’s own actions and failure to rein in Netanyahu contributed to the increasingly explosive situation. The head of US Central Command, Gen Michael Kurilla, arrived in Israel in the wake of the assassinations to discuss “joint preparations in the region, as part of the response to threats in the Middle East” — a reference to ‘threats’ from Iran and its regional allies dubbed as the ‘axis of resistance’.\nIsrael’s escalation has pushed the Middle East to the brink of a wider war.\nIn fact, the US has continued to back and arm the Israeli government throughout the 10 months of its genocidal war that has wreaked so much death and destruction in Gaza. As the war enters the eleventh month, the situation across the Strip has become even more dire and desperate. Relentless Israeli air strikescontinue to target schools, refugee camps and residential buildings, laying waste to much of Gaza. There is no safe shelter fordisplaced Palestinians. A humanitarian disaster continues to unfold. In the West Bank, casualties are rising as violent Israeli crackdowns intensify. Israel has also stepped up air strikes across southern Lebanon and assassinated a Hamas official in Sidon.\nJordan’s foreign minister has warned that “Israel is pushing the entire region into the abyss of a regional war by continuing its aggression on Gaza, violating international law and attacking the sovereignty of states”. But the question is, what is the international community, especially Arab states, doing to stop this?\n\nAn extraordinaryOIC ministerial meetinglast week issued a statement holding “Israel, the illegal occupying power, fully responsible for this heinous attack” (on Haniyeh), which it described as “a serious infringement” of Iran’s sovereignty. But that was it. In fact, the conduct of Arab states has been more than disappointing, to put it mildly, and has hardly matched the expectation of Muslims across the world.\nNevertheless, if Israel believes military aggression and its assassination strategy will weaken the Palestinian armed resistance and annihilate Hamas, it is utterly mistaken. History has shown time and again that no amount of violent repression and brutal force can diminish an occupied people’s will to resist. Nor can liberation movements be destroyed by killing its leaders."}]}

Gerges, who teaches at the London School of Economics, offers sharp analysis in his book on the evolution of the Middle East in the postcolonial era and seeks to explain what has led to present-day turbulence and tensions.\nThe main thesis of the book is that the Middle East’s instability is not rooted in factors inherent in the region such as ancient hatreds, tribalism and chronic violence, which many Western scholars and policymakers have assumed. It is mostly the consequence of America’s disastrous foreign policy decisions during the Cold War and its interventions that have left such a lasting legacy. Gerges shows convincingly that the Cold War confrontation between the US and Soviet Union turned the Middle East into a battleground for proxy conflicts, marking a continuity with the legacy of ‘dysfunction’ left by European colonialism.\nWashington’s obsessive concern with countering Russian communism, efforts to establish a Pax Americana and secure access to cheap oil drove it to ally with repressive autocrats. These regimes were assured American patronage so long as they submitted to US hegemonic aims and ensured an uninterrupted supply of oil. This denuded the region of any postcolonial peace dividend and undermined these countries’ independence. “Resources that should have gone to development were directed to the military-security sector.” Washington’s aim to build a “new informal empire” thwarted the evolution of modern pluralistic political systems and strong economies independent of the West. This diminished the Middle East’s chance of achieving a peaceful future.\nIn relating the story of lost opportunities and dashed hopes, Gerges focuses on key flashpoints that “sowed the seeds of discontent, hubris and subsequent conflict”. They include the 1953 CIA-sponsored coup against prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh in Iran and confrontation with Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser in the mid-1950s. The author uses these ‘ruptures’ to reinterpret the history of the region and challenge the narrative popularised by Western scholars. He sees ruptures in Iran and Egypt leading to the defeat of “secular-leaning nationalist visions”. This in turn enabled “puritanical religious narratives” and movements to gain ascendancy in the 1950s and 1960s across the region and beyond. Popular leaders were replaced by those subservient to the West. The consequences of these events, writes Gerges, still haunt the region.\nThe consequences of policies aimed at building an ‘informal empire’ still haunt the Middle East.\nHe argues that before these two pivotal events, the US was viewed positively and with optimism in the region. Freed from the shackles of European colonialism, people looked forward to an era of economic and political freedom and prosperity. But soon, US policies meant Washington mimicked European imperialists by seeking to build an ‘informal empire’ — a term that resonates in the book — whose results were virtually the same as colonial rule. He cites political scientist Atul Kohli, who defined informal empire as predicated on “an alliance in which elites in the imperial country allow elites on the global periphery to share in economic growth in exchange for establishing stable but ultimately subservient governments there”. Gerges details how the US “exploited pliant local regimes, established extensive military bases, penetrated national economies, staged military interventions and imposed punishing multilateral sanctions”. These policies were obviously executed at the cost of people and countries. They hobbled political development, liberalisation and social change and, instead, pushed the region on the path of militarism, authoritarianism, strengthening of political Islam and intensification of sectarian rivalries. US decisions to ally with Islamist groups against secular-oriented nationalists proved just as fateful.\nIn the chapter subtitled ‘What could have been’, the author discusses the two events he sees as transformational and consequential to the region’s subsequent trajectory — ouster of Mossadegh in 1953 and American moves against Nasser that led to the Suez crisis of 1956. These triggered a chain of reactions and counterreactions that were to change the Middle East’s complexion. They also seriously undermined US relations with people in the Arab and Muslim world. Popular, progressive nationalist leaders like Mossadegh and Nasser were branded as ‘disguised communists’ because of their assertions of independence and pursuit of modernisation. Washington’s preference was to back ‘authoritarian strongmen’ on the grounds of ‘stability’ — a policy Gerges argues persists till today. Accompanying this was the expedient Western view that Islam and Arab culture were incompatible with democracy.\nIn answering the ‘what if’ question had the US not overthrown Mossadegh, the author posits that a democratic Iran would have evolved, at peace with itself and serving as an example to its neighbours. In Egypt, US hostility towards Nasser, although no democrat but a secular nationalist leader intent on modernising his country and pursuing an independent path, also had damaging consequences. It changed regional dynamics and shaped issues of war and peace. Gerges recalls that Nasser retaliated by turning to Moscow for arms and opposing Arab monarchs and leaders who joined the US military alliance, which in turn led to the Arab Cold War. Lost in the process was balance and equilibrium in the Arab state system with geopolitical rivalries dashing hopes of unity and regional economic integration. According to Gerges, “America’s imperial overreach and Cold War crusade ignited and escalated geostrategic rivalries in the region.”\nThe conclusion Gerges draws from his detailed assessment of covert and overt external interventions during the Cold War is this. Today’s grim situation in the Middle East would have been very different if Washington had shown tolerance for countries that disagreed with its foreign policy and declined to serve its economic interests at the cost of their own. Of course, one should add that blind US support for Israel drove a dagger into the heart of the region and destabilised it, which is so tragically illustrated by the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza today. This book is a must read for its riveting revisionist account of the Middle East’s modern history."}]}

The last assembly elections took place 10 years ago. After the assembly was dissolved in 2018 the state has been under direct rule by Delhi. In August 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government wrote another grim chapter in J&K’s tragic history by illegally annexing the state, bifurcating and absorbing it into the Indian union. This was in defiance of UN Security Council Resolutions that prohibit any material change in the state, which is recognised as an international dispute.\nSince 2019, the Modi government has carried out far-reaching changes — administrative, electoral, demographic and in domicile rules — to pave the way for elections with the aim of consolidating its 2019 action and claiming this has been ‘accepted’ by the people of J&K with ‘normalcy’ returning there. In fact, last month, before announcement of the election schedule, the government substantially increased the powers of the lieutenant-governor (LG), who is nominated by Delhi, to sharply limit the authority of the next ‘elected’ government. The Modi government has opted to maintain central control knowing that BJP or its proxies cannot win the election and being unwilling to cede authority to anyone else. The LG was given sweeping administrative and security powers — over the police, transfer and postings of civil servants, sanction for prosecution and other public order issues. His decisions will not be subject to review by the Council of Ministers, with his nominees authorised to attend cabinet meetings.\nThis provoked an uproar in J&K and was denounced by the national opposition as another move to disempower the people there. It was sharply criticised by both pro-India Kashmiri parties, National Conference and People’s Democratic Party. Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti described it as reducing J&K to a municipality while Omar Abdullah said the chief minister’s office had been downgraded to “a powerless rubber stamp”. Congress condemned it as the “murder of democracy”. It was also critiqued in its latest report by the ‘Forum for Human Rights in Jammu and Kashmir,’ an independent organisation comprising concerned Indian citizens.\nThis however was only the latest attempt to disempower the people of occupied J&K. Two key post-2019 actions aimed to reshape the electoral map and alter the state of play to the detriment of the Kashmiri people. In 2020 India’s Delimitation Commission carved out new electoral constituencies with Jammu given six more seats in the 90-member J&K Assembly while Kashmir was given only one more, even though Kashmir’s population far exceeds that of Jammu. This gerrymandering was designed to give Jammu greater representation to reduce the political weight of Muslims in the assembly and shift the balance to Hindus.\nPolls for a toothless assembly cannot serve as a substitute for a genuine exercise in self-determination.\nDemographic changes through new domicile laws also sought to disenfranchise Kashmiris. After abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A of the Indian constitution, non-Kashmiri outsiders became eligible to domicile status and to enlist as voters. An indeterminate number of domicile certificates were issued over the past five years. In July 2022 even temporary residents were given voting rights. Again, this was decried in J&K as a brazen effort to change its demography.\nAgainst the backdrop of such manipulative moves and gerrymandering what can be expected in the upcoming election albeit to a toothless assembly? What will the poll mean for the BJP government’s ‘consolidation’ aims? It is widely predicted that Omar Abdullah’s National Conference will emerge as the lead party in the election. In its election manifesto the party has pledged to fight for the restoration of Article 370, which gave J&K special status, repeal all post-2019 laws that eroded Kashmir’s autonomy and work for India-Pakistan dialogue. Abdullah also made it clear that NC’s first order of business would be for the assembly to adopt a resolution calling for restoration of statehood and rejecting Delhi’s decision to strip J&K of its special status. If this happens it will hardly advance the BJP’s agenda in the territory. In fact, a tussle between the ‘elected’ government and the LG will be inevitable, which far from establishing ‘stability’ will plunge the region into renewed political turmoil.\nThen there is the engineer Rasheed factor and how it plays out in the election. Abdul Rasheed Sheikh won in the Lok Sabha elections from Baramulla. A fierce opponent of abrogation, he won from jail defeating former chief minister Omar Abdullah. Being incarcerated since 2017 on terrorism funding charges he has emerged as a symbol of defiance of Delhi. His election campaign made waves across the Valley and drew support across the board especially from youth. His victory reflected the depth of Kashmiri anger with Delhi in what was widely seen in the Valley as a vote against India. The question then is whether his Awami Ittehad Party can build on that momentum and make a significant impact in the assembly poll.\nArguably the most important factor will be whether people express their anger with Delhi and rejection of occupation through a protest vote. Over the decades elections in J&K have been seen by Kashmiris as a meaningless and illegitimate exercise under Indian occupation. This has been reflected in the abysmally low public participation especially in view of boycott calls by genuine Kashmiri leaders, denuding the polls of any legitimacy. However, the relatively higher voter participation in the recent Lok Sabha election suggests that casting the vote may become a ‘new’ form of resistance and expression of the Kashmiri aspiration for freedom.\nAll this indicates that not only is the Modi government unlikely to achieve its aim of securing endorsement of its 2019 action but may confront new challenges from an election which gives a fillip to the popular Kashmiri demand for ‘azadi’. Elections in J&K can never be a substitute for a genuine exercise of self-determination for the Kashmiri people, but the upcoming one may become a vehicle to express their rejection of occupation."}]}

It has neither clarity nor coherence to meet complex regional and international challenges or respond to fast-moving global developments.\nLacking any vision or strategic direction, the country’s foreign policy consists of sporadic, ad hoc and reactive endeavours. Compounding the incoherence is the tendency to deal with individual issue areas in silos, overlooking their link with other areas, rather than evolve an integrated policy keeping in view the overall external environment.\nThis is mainly the consequence of the absence of an overarching policy framework with clearly spelt-out and prioritised goals. Rhetoric has often substituted for policy, while goals have outmatched diplomatic resources. The inability for many years to frame long-term policy objectives has often led to muddled goals reflecting tactical, short-term considerations.\n\nPolicymakers work with outdated paradigms and mental maps of the past. They have not been replaced by a framework that is predicated on the country’s present domestic strength and international relevance, while adapting that to new global realities. True, efforts at policy reorientation have been stymied by domestic political instability and economic difficulties. But they have also been impeded by other factors, including lack of focus and imagination.\nA new government isexpectedto take stock of the country’s foreign relations, offer a foreign policy vision and spell out future priorities. Five months on, Shehbaz Sharif’s government has done none of the above. A broad foreign policy review is essential, given the geopolitical changes sweeping the world. With power shifts and realignments taking place in an unsettled, multipolar world marked by mounting geopolitical tensions, this big picture has to be carefully assessed. This would help to adjust policy to these changes and reshape the country’s strategy to more effectively pursue goals. A review would inject clarity both about goals and strategy and encourage a proactive approach that leverages opportunities.\nIt is ad hoc, reactive and spasmodic and lacks any vision or strategic direction.\nDespite these obvious benefits, the Sharif government has shown no interest in such a review. The prime minister and even foreign minister have given episodic attention to foreign policy, mistakingobligatory overseas visitsfor policy. No political direction has been provided to a ministry that today is institutionally at its weakest — and most demoralised — as a cumulative result of years of neglect and lack of resources. Moreover, having a foreign minister with additional responsibilities as deputy prime minister and chair of dozens of economic committees means his attention is divided, leaving the foreign ministry with a part-time head.\nAbove all, the government has decided, in the hybrid governing arrangement that prevails today, to cede more space on foreign policy to the military establishment, judging this as a ‘safe’ course to follow.\n\nThis has resulted in fragmentation of the decision-making process, confusion about who is responsible for what, exclusion of the foreign ministry from key policy areas (including Afghanistan) and weak implementation of policy goals. The military has always had a key role in foreign policy, which has long been security-oriented. This is not unusual. But today, that role has become far more extensive.\nAgainst this backdrop, what is the state of Pakistan’s two key bilateral relationships?\nRelations with strategic ally China are facing challenges. Several issues have emerged that require deft handling to keep ties on a positive trajectory and prevent backsliding. The most important is allaying Beijing’s security concerns about Chinese personnel working in Pakistan. A spate ofattacks and killingsof Chinese workers this year have prompted China, Pakistan’s biggest investor, to publicly urge Islamabad to guarantee the safety of thousands of its workers. During the visit of a senior Chinese official to Islamabad in June, Beijing’s message was delivered publicly in an unusually sharp manner. He warned that security issues couldthreaten CPEC’s futureand said the deteriorating security situation was “shaking the confidence of Chinese investors”. Privately, he politely reiterated Beijing’s concern about the country’s instability driven by unceasing political squabbles.\nAdding to challenges is the high-profile manner in which the government recently asked China forloan rolloversand rescheduling of debt to independent power producers. Publicly making these requests put China in an awkward position, because this has implications for its lending to other countries. The prime minister himself went public saying he had written to the Chinese leadership requesting “debt reprofiling”.\n\nMoreover, public controversy, reflected in the media on the IPP issue, further disconcerted China, already frustrated over the non-repatriation of IPP dividends. Inconclusive discussions onIPP debt reliefindicate the Chinese want to know what Pakistan’s long-term plan is, for which they still await a response. The government has also failed to see that its constant requests for financing/rollovers are overburdening relations with its closest ally.\nPakistan’s other critical bilateral relationship, with the US, has been at an inflection point since theAmerican military withdrawal from Afghanistanin 2021. This diminished Pakistan’s importance and geopolitical relevance for Washington, while Islamabad’s strategic ties with China placed obvious limits. The changed context needs an imaginative approach by Islamabad to engage Washington to reset ties, which currently have little substantive content. Any reset has to now wait for the outcome of the American presidential election. It is yet to be determined whether a government with no foreign policy vision will be able to find space between the Pakistan-China strategic relationship and US-India partnership to rebuild ties with Washington.\nIn the immediate neighbourhood, the foreign policy drift is reflected in the fact that Pakistan has troubled relations in varying degrees with all three neighbours. For decades, Pakistan’s security and foreign policy aimed to prevent a two-front scenario ofhot borderswith neighbours. Today, it has ended up with unstable or insecure borders with two neighbours and unresolved border problems with a third one. While with India there are severe limits to what can be done, it is important to stabilise theAfghan frontrather than leave the situation in a state of dangerous drift, especially with Balochistan under fierce militant attack.\nSpace prevents a discussion of Pakistan’s other key relationships. But what is apparent is the need for the country to raise its diplomatic game. This can only happen if it addresses policy deficits and evolves a well-thought-out foreign policy designed to achieve clearly defined national objectives."}]}

They also discussed the possibility of a call between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping to follow up on understandings reached last year in their face-to-face meetings in San Francisco and, earlier, in Bali.\nIt may be surprising for these talks to have taken place when the Biden administration is a lame duck. But the fact that the Chinese took them seriously underlines their desire to stabilise the relationship before the White House gets a new occupant.\n\nFor the Chinese president to receive Sullivan was a strong signal by Beijing that it wants to calm the turbulent relationship before uncertainties set in of how the next US president might act. President Xi told Sullivan he hoped the US would see China’s development in a positive light and work with China to find a “right way” for the two major countries to “coexist”. Both sides, he reiterated, should decide whether they are “rivals or partners.”\nDifferences over contentious issues did not, of course, narrow — but the positive atmospherics of the interaction did help lower the temperature. Both sides agreed to implement mutual commitments on countering narcotics and AI safety and risk. Also agreed was the need for military leaders at the theatre command level to speak to each other to limit the risk of miscalculation.\nThese are welcome efforts to put relations on a stable track. But the key question for the future remains: how will the winning presidential candidate deal with Beijing?\nAmerica’s policy of containing Beijing is not expected to change. China will continue to be seen as a strategic challenge. From most accounts, Chinese officials seem apprehensive that, irrespective of who wins the election, Washington will adopt a combative approach. TheFinancial Timesrecently quoted a Chinese professor as saying both candidates are “two bowls of poison for Beijing”. The Chinese apprehensions are well founded, given the bipartisan political consensus in the US is to act tough with China. Moreover, America’s deep state regards China as an enemy, not just a competitor.\nNeither Trump nor Harris will want a collision course with China even as they intensify competition.\nBut, beyond this, would Donald Trump and Kamala Harris differ in their management of America’s relationship with China?\n\nTrump is largely a known quantity, but then he is also unpredictable and impulsive. This makes it difficult to predict his future conduct, especially as he is capable of suddenly changing course. There is even less certainty about the foreign policy a Harris administration would pursue. However, both see China as the major competitor and adversary, and neither is expected to soften their position if elected.\nTrump is expected to continue his ‘America First’, unilateralist approach that characterised his previous administration. He has struck an aggressive tone during his campaign, saying he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports by 60 per cent. But he has also said he would seek a good relationship with Beijing. In aninterviewwithFox Newslast month, he said that while there is no greater critic of China than him, he respected China and President Xi.\nTherefore, Trump will likely take a tough position on trade issues, just like in his first term. At the same time, though most of his team members are hawks on China, he can easily override their views. He is capable of being pragmatic, as his business instincts would urge him to be transactional and strike trade deals rather than seek to subdue a rival or impose sanctions. His admiration for ‘strongmen’ might also encourage pragmatism, especially as he often boasts about the “great relationship” he had with President Xi.\nOn Taiwan, Trump has never said America would intervene militarily if China ‘invaded’ Taiwan, as Biden once declared. Otherwise, too, Trump would be averse to any military conflict with China. He has been critical of Taiwan, saying it should pay the US for defending it. He has also assailed Taiwan for “not giving anything to the US” and instead taking away “100pc of the semiconductor industry”. While this is a mistaken view, Trump has never let facts stand between him and his assertions.\nHisstance on Ukrainecould have a knock-on effect on ties with China. Often claiming he can end the war “in a day”, Trump is likely to push for talks to end a conflict he says, “should never have happened.”\n\nHe says he has a plan to end the war, which he will unveil if elected. “I’ll have a deal made, guaranteed,” he has claimed. Trump is also not interested in continuing military aid to Ukraine. If he makes good on his promise to end the war, this will remove a growing irritant in relations with China, which the Biden administration has accused of helping Russia’s military-industrial base.\nKamala Harris’s foreign policy pronouncements have been vague. Also, she has never been to China. But she is expected to continue the policy approach of the Biden administration, of which she was a part for four years. Biden took the rivalry with China to another level by raising tariffs on a wider range of Chinese imports and enhancing military aid to Taiwan. He also unleashed an intense tech war by curbs and sanctions on Chinese companies.\nOn containing China, Harris won’t be any different. In her speech to the Democratic Convention, she pledged to ensure “that America — not China — wins the competition for the 21st century”. She will likely seek to cement anti-China alliances in Asia, as Biden sought to do. Harris would also be less able to resist the US military’s view of China as an enemy.\nWhatever the differences between Trump and Harris, neither would want unmanaged tensions with China to push the two countries towards a collision course or a rupture. That would have disastrous consequences not just for the US and China, but also the rest of the world."}]}

It is no longer able to shape the strategic environment in its neighbourhood to advance its interests, much less influence global geopolitics.\nThe country has faced reversals on a number of fronts, notably Kashmir and Afghanistan. Once an active diplomatic player in the Middle East, today its principal engagement with the region is toseek loansfrom rich Arab countries. Even the country’s most critical bilateral relationship — with China — isfacing challenges. Its international relevance has been progressively declining and its diplomatic options shrinking.\nA combination of factors is responsible for this situation. Pakistan’s economic weakness, political instability, unceasing turmoil, poor governance, continuing internal security threats and strategic confusion. The key question raised by this is why the country was strategically ‘relevant’ in the past when some of these characteristics were also present.\n\nThe answer is that factors or developments extraneous to Pakistan gave it a significant role and importance in global geopolitics. For over two decades after its independence, it was the Cold War that catapulted Pakistan into the position of a much sought-after ally by the US-led West in its fight against communism. Membership of Western-sponsored military alliances enabled it to benefit from significant economic and military assistance.\nIn the 1980s, it was the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan that propelled Pakistan in a ‘front-line’ role in the international coalition’s campaign to roll back Russian occupation. The defeat and disintegration of the Soviet Union was followed by a period in which Pakistan’s geostrategic importance declined precipitously.9/11dramatically changed that. Pakistan once again assumed a front-line role in the so-calledWar on Terror. This enabled the country to coast along for two decades in a globally prominent role as a result of the US and Nato countries’ need for Pakistan’s cooperation in the war in Afghanistan.\nWhat all three phases underlined was that external dynamics, regional geopolitical storms or big power rivalries enhanced Pakistan’s international importance. Thus, factors extraneous to the country affected transformations in Pakistan’s global status, not its intrinsic importance. But in the changed international environment of the post-Cold War era what increasingly mattered was countries’ own attributes that gave them importance. There Pakistan came up short.\nThis should have been an urgent call to adjust to new realities. External overreach and internal underreach had characterised Pakistan’s past priorities and actions. That was no longer tenable. But successive governments failed to see the world had changed fundamentally and the days of living off geopolitical rents were over. Ruling elites didn’t understand the only way the country could reverse the erosion in its strategic importance was by strengthening and empowering itself at home and putting its own house in order. But old habits persisted as did outdated paradigms.\nThere are no short cuts to rebooting Pakistan’s international standing and influence.\nPakistan now has to operate in and adapt to a vastly transformed international environment. The post-Cold War era has given way to a world of growing multipolarity, where power is being redistributed and where there is intense competition among states for global influence. In this transformed landscape, it is increasingly the economic power of countries that gives them international clout and heft. Nations with strong economies and who are technology innovators are the ones that have become consequential in the international arena.\n\nThe growing importance and rising clout of ‘middle powers’ in global affairs reflects this. Middle powers are not superpowers but have characteristics that give them the ability to influence and shape geopolitics. Most middle powers have strong economies and possess other positive attributes that provide them leverage in global affairs to pursue their national interests as well as the ability to build multiple relationships through skilful diplomacy.\nThe structural changes and dispersal of power in the international system — the currency of power having changed — has created an enabling environment for middle power diplomatic activism and for them to wield greater influence and become global players. Middle powers play off the US-China competition to strengthen their bargaining position even while they seek to enhance relations with both global powers. They try to avoid getting into the crosshairs of that confrontation but also reap advantages from it. This urges both theUS and Chinato pay more attention to them to ensure they are not firmly tied to their rival’s camp.\nPakistan doesn’t figure today among middle powers that include many countries of the Global South, such as Turkiye, India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Singapore among several others. But it has all the potential to become one.\nTo be internationally relevant, it must first and foremost build a strong and resilient economy that is not reliant on external life support, on bailouts and borrowing — an economy integrated into the global economy, which at present it is far from being. This needs efficient governance, political stability and an end to the political squabbles that keep the country in such an unsettled, distracted and divided state. It also needs an educated citizenry and workforce that has the ability to innovate and contribute to scientific and technological progress. All this will engender national self-confidence that can empower the country with hope and optimism, which acts as a force multiplier.\n\nAlong with building domestic strength, incorporating soft power in the country’s diplomatic strategy will also help to improve its global standing and reputation. Understood as a country’s qualities or behaviour that appeals to others, soft power can be an indispensable tool to boost its international influence and image. Pakistan has severalsoft powerresources which if identified and leveraged intelligently can help create positive perceptions about the country and build trust, which in turn, can elevate its position and elicit support from the international community for its foreign policy goals.\nTo sum up, Pakistan’s international relevance now depends on its domestic repositioning and the choices made at home to strengthen the economy, establish durable political stability, provide competent governance, invest in people and address its human development deficits. It also involves fashioning and implementing a coherent and imaginative foreign policy. What should be clear is that there are no shortcuts to rebooting Pakistan’s global influence."}]}

This has become a fatal distraction from governance. It is also counterproductive. Far from weakening the opposition, it is injecting greater resolve in opposition ranks to push back against the government’s actions.\nOn the constitutional amendment, the government beat a hasty retreat as it failed to muster the necessary parliamentary numbers for the sweeping changes it sought.\nEarlier this month, the PML-N government and its allies made a frantic attempt to push a controversial constitutional package through parliament in a politically motivated move. It kept the contents of the amendment under wraps, allowed no debate, yet expected lawmakers to blindly support what they had not even seen.\nThe aim of the judicial re-engineering was to undermine the independence of the superior judiciary and subordinate it to the executive. Members of the legal fraternity rightly condemned this as an assault on the Constitution. The proposed establishment of a constitutional court packed with judges and headed by a judge chosen by the prime minister will denude the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction in constitutional cases.\nAnother provision was designed to ensure the continuance of Qazi Faez Isa, who is due to retire in October, as chief justice. The move came after a series of clashes between the government and judiciary and official frustration with judgments seen as advantaging the opposition. But for all its frenetic efforts, the government faced a setback and was compelled to ‘postpone’ tabling the constitutional amendment for lack of the needed two-thirds majority. But it is now set to defy the Supreme Court order on reserved seats.\nMeanwhile the government’s efforts to contain Imran Khan’s PTI have continued. It was exemplified by the restrictions and obstacles placed in the path of the party’s public rally in Islamabad and arrests of several of its leaders. Its Lahore jalsa encountered similar impediments. This was only the latest coercive measure taken against PTI, which over the past year has involved innumerable cases against its leaders.\nAggression, however, begets aggression. The opposition sought to resist such actions by becoming more combative. PTI lawmakers are adamant on continuing their protests in parliament and outside.\nThe PML-N-led government has failed to see it has more to lose from unremitting confrontational politics. The political calm needed for the country to solve its fundamental problems is obviously being upended by escalation in political tensions. This has fuelled uncertainty and left the public in a state of despondency. No surprise, then, that a recent opinion survey conducted by Ipsos found 89 per cent of people felt the country was headed in the wrong direction. Nine out of 10 Pakistanis lacked confidence in the country’s future.\nThis may seem like a rerun of an old movie but it heightens risks for the country’s stability.\nParliamentary proceedings have been reduced to theatrical displays of unseemly conduct and slanging matches between the treasury and opposition benches. Instead of debating the issues that confront the country and worry the public, parliamentarians on both sides of the aisle seek to demonise each other. Talk of a dialogue between the government and opposition has remained just that — talk about talks, with neither side showing any seriousness.\nEvery so often, statements in parliament by government leaders about a dialogue have not led to any outreach to the opposition. For their part, PTI leaders have reiterated they will only talk to the establishment as they see the government lacking any power or legitimacy. In any case, the constitutional amendment attempt, vigorously opposed by PTI, only widened the government-opposition divide.\nAll this has familiar echoes of the past — a government unwilling to engage with the opposition, jailing opposition leaders, trying to steamroll legislation and a desperate opposition in constant protest mode against a backdrop of economic gloom, weak governance and ubiquitous establishment pulling the strings from behind the scenes.\nThis seems like the rerun of an old movie. But it doesn’t minimise the risks for the country’s stability. The risks are even greater than in the past because of the intensely polarised state of the country and unprecedented confluence of challenges.\nThe economic challenge is, of course, the most consequential. The government might think that with the IMF expected to soon approve a $7 billion bailout package, the worst of the country’s economic troubles will be over. But the real task lies ahead to implement a tough Fund programme and take other difficult measures to stabilise an economy that is not yet out of the woods.\nWhat the government seems unwilling to acknowledge is that political turmoil and uncertainty puts any sustainable economic recovery at risk. It also makes it harder to implement necessary but unpopular measures. An economic rebound can only be sustained by building a high level of confidence which requires a stable and predictable political environment.\nThe country’s deteriorating internal security situation also merits greater attention from the government. In the first eight months of the year, 757 people were reportedly killed in violent incidents. August was a particularly deadly month, with over 100 people killed in a fresh wave of militant attacks in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. On one day alone — Aug 26 — terrorist violence claimed the lives of over 50 people across Balochistan as militants stormed police stations, executed passengers on a bus, blocked roads and blew up railway tracks.\nThis should have prompted an urgent meeting of the National Security Committee. But the government did not convene one, while the interior minister made the astonishing claim that only one SHO (station house police officer) was enough to handle terrorism in the province. As terrorist activities continue in KP, with 29 attacks last month, the federal government and law- enforcing agencies need to address the mounting challenge in close collaboration with the PTI-run KP government, not in opposition to it. The KP government, headed by a volatile chief minister prone to verbal excess, also needs to show responsibility.\nThe test of the government is how it deals with these pressing challenges, what it delivers to the people and whether its actions earn the public’s respect and confidence. The PML-N coalition is falling short on all these counts."}]}

In his farewell speech to the UN General Assembly last week, President Joe Biden spoke proudly about how he defended Ukraine and its people against Russian aggression. But speaking about the Middle East, he applied different principles.\nIsrael was cast as the victim with barely any concern expressed for the plight of the Palestinian people facing aggression and oppression. He urged the world to help Ukraine win the war and said the US will not “look away” unless there was a just and durable peace based on the UN Charter.\nOn the Middle East, Biden focused on the “horrors of October 7” and hostages captured by Hamas, saying little about the death and destruction wrought by Israel’s year-long, ongoing war on Gaza. The UN Charter was not invoked despite its countless violations by Israel. Biden mentioned the need for a ceasefire in Gaza and of averting a full-scale war in the region. But these words sounded hollow given the role his administration has played over the months in the conflict.\nThat role is evident from the several times the USvetoed resolutionsfor a ceasefire in the UN Security Council and from its relentless arming of Israel. In the past year, Washington has given Israel over $12 billion in arms supplies and deployed additional military forces in the region to ‘protect Israel’. Last week, Israel secured an additional $8.7bn in US military aid. Over the past 11 months, the Biden administration hardly spoke of the tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians killed — over 41,000 now — by Israel’s military offensive and bombings. It never condemned repeated Israeli attacks on hospitals and medical staff, with official spokespersons often fumbling over media questions about assaults that are a blatant violation of international humanitarian laws.\nThis stance handed Israel a licence to carry out atrocities, ethnic cleansing and defy the UNSC’s calls for a fighting pause to allow aid into Gaza. It also flouted rulings of the International Court of Justice. Not only has Israel been emboldened to continue its genocidal war, it also felt encouraged to launch crackdowns in the occupied West Bank, assassinateHamasandHezbollahcommanders in third countries and intensify assaults on Lebanon.\nNot a murmur was heard from Washington — and many Western capitals — when Israel carried outpager explosionsin Lebanon. If any other country had done this it would have been denounced by the West as a terrorist attack, which is what it was. Israel ramped up deadly raids across the West Bank, resulting in scores of civilian deaths and unprecedented destruction of infrastructure.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has exploited the Biden administration’s lame-duck phase and political considerations in America’s election season to act with impunity and ignore warnings from Washington about the danger of a regional war.\nHe has also calculated that the US is unwilling to use its leverage (suspend weapon supplies) to restrain Tel Aviv, especially as it keeps reiterating support for Israel’s ‘unconditional right to defend itself’. Belated US efforts for a ceasefire and hostage deal but without exerting pressure on Israel meant it gave the Israeli government sufficient time to conduct a brutal war while pretending to pursue peace.\nNetanyahu has shown no interest in a ceasefire or peace deal not least because his political survival depends on continuing the war. He faces charges of corruption. A defiant Netanyahu spurned international urgings for a ceasefire in his UNGA address. Meanwhile, some members of the Biden administration seemed to buy Israel’s disingenuous ‘escalate to de-escalate’ argument in what it calls a “new phase” in the conflict. That is how Tel Aviv cast its multiple, devastatingair strikes on Lebanon— the biggest in decades — which have already claimed over 700 lives. This has also sparked fears of a wider multi-front war that could engulf the entire region.\nIsrael’s military escalation has pushed the region to the brink of a full-scale conflict.\nIran’s stance will be critical given the mounting pressure on its ally Hezbollah, especially after theassassinationof Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. So far Tehran has acted with restraint. President Masoud Pezeshkian has avoided falling for the Israeli bait to enter the war. He did not order any retaliatory response to Israel’s assassination of Hamas leaderIsmail Haniyehon Iranian soil. While attending the UNGA session in New York, Pezeshkian said Israel was trying to drag his country into a wider war that he had no wish to do. However, Iran will face a predicament if Israel, which ordered its troops to be ready for a ground offensive in Lebanon, crosses another red line.\n\nWhile the UNGA session has seen an outpouring of international support for the Palestinians and strong denunciations of Israel from leaders of the Global South that does not obscure the hypocrisy and double standards practised by Western governments. With the notable exception of Western nations such as Spain, Ireland and Norway, the rest have shown utter disregard for international law and fundamental human rights in their blind support for Israel. They denounce Russian military actions and targeting of civilians in Ukraine, but have refused to apply the same principle to Gaza. They never asked themselves if there is any justification to target civilians, kill children, bomb hospitals, displace people and starve a population in Gaza.\nInstead, they have gone on and on about Israel’s right to defend itself as if that gives Tel Aviv carte blanche to violate every international law and norm, commit war crimes, attack the sovereignty of states and seek to annihilate an entire nation. Far from assuring Israel security, that only multiplies its enemies and over time strengthens resistance to occupation.\nArab governments also haven’t covered themselves in glory by failing to do anything to stop Israel from carrying on its genocidal war. Statements of condemnation have been aplenty. But their inaction has served as an enabler for Israel to continue military aggression.\nThe Middle East stands at a dangerous crossroads. Israeli escalation has pushed the region to the brink of a full-scale conflict. For the brave Palestinian people, this is the darkest period in their tortured history. But the past demonstrates that their will to resist a cruel occupation will endure whatever the challenges."}]}

And respond it did by raining abarrage of missilesover Israel.\nThe aim was to send a clear message that it had the capability and reach to punish Israel for its murderous actions and re-establish a level of deterrence. It was also designed to push the US to rein in Israel.\nTehran’s hand was forced by Israel’s unrelenting aggressive actions even though Iranian leaders repeatedly stated they had no interest in entering a conflict which they saw as a trap by Tel Aviv to widen the war. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian reiterated this after the missile attack. At a press conference in Doha, he declared Iran did not seek a war. It had shown patience but that emboldened Israel to act with greater impunity.\n\nIn remarks to a cabinet meeting, he disclosed that Western powers had urged Tehran to exercise restraint after the assassination of Hamas chiefIsmail Haniyeh, holding out the promise of a ceasefire in Gaza. The truce didn’t happen while Israel’s continuing military offensive in Gaza was met by silence by those calling for restraint. He warned of a tougher response if Israel attacked Iran but stressed the need to prevent the crisis from escalating.\nIsrael of coursethreatened retaliationfor Iran’s ballistic missile attack with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying Tehran made a big mistake and will “pay for it”. Perhaps Israel chooses Oct 7, the anniversary of the Hamas assault, to launch an attack. While Tel Aviv is reported to be assessing several military options, the region is on a knife-edge. This dangerous situation prompted UN Secretary General António Guterres to call for urgent efforts to prevent an all-out war, which would have “profound and devastating consequences” for the region. He told an emergency UN Security Council meeting that “the raging fires in the Middle East were fast becoming an inferno”.\nCan a full-scale conflict be averted in the Middle East? One scenario is that tit-for-tat actions between Iran and Israel take place in a measured way while the international community weighs in decisively to ensure that confrontation between the two foes remains limited and doesn’t escalate out of control. There is indication such efforts are underway. The role of the US is obviously crucial. Although Washington has declared its backing for Israel’s right to militarily respond to Tehran’s action and said it is considering sanctions against Iran, President Joe Biden is urging Tel Aviv to “respond in proportion”.\nThe fate of the Middle East hangs in the balance with Iran and Israel set on a collision course.\nThe US and its G7 allies have cautioned Netanyahu against an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which would mark a major escalation leading to a full-fledged Israel-Iran war that would plunge the region into uncharted territory. Biden has made it clear he will not support an Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear sites. As for Israel targeting Iran’s oil facilities, Biden first said he had discussed that possibility. But later he claimed he had advised Israel to consider ‘other alternatives’ to oilfield strikes.\nSuch an attack would shake the global energy market and trigger an oil price surge. Prices have already started rising especially after Biden’s earlier remarks. Would Washington really want American consumers to face higher oil prices at election time in the US? Disruption in oil supplies would have global repercussions. Half of China’s oil imports, for example, come from the Middle East, including from Iran.\nThere are fears an Israeli strike on Iranian oil installations could provoke Tehran to disrupt the oil flow from the Strait of Hormuz, which will send the oil price soaring. These considerations are driving appeals to the Israeli leadership from the US and its Western allies to avoid a major step up the escalatory ladder.\n\nThe other scenario is of a massive attack by Israel followed by equally strong retaliation by Iran, which descends into a no-holds-barred military confrontation between them with uncertain and devastating repercussions for the region. It is possible that urgings for ‘proportionality’ from its Western benefactors including a lame-duck Biden administration are spurned by the Israeli leadership. Emboldened by assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders and ‘weakening’ of the axis of resistance, Israel may now want to deliver a ‘decisive blow’ to Iran in order to reshape the region’s strategic landscape.\nFor its part, Tehran has reportedly conveyed to the US that while it doesn’t seek war, “the phase of unilateral self-restraint” is over, indicating it would respond with full force to an Israeli retaliatory strike. An Israeli strike would be met by an “unconventional response” that could include targeting Israeli infrastructure. Iran’s armed allies in the axis of resistance are already threatening to intensify their operations against Israel. In the worst-case scenario, a full-blown war could erupt with unpredictable consequences for the region and global stability.\nWhile the region and the world wait to see how the Israel-Iran confrontation will play out, Israel has continued its fierce military campaign in Gaza, bombing schools, refugee camps and an orphanage, with the death toll now exceeding 41,000. It has carried out a ground invasion of Lebanon despite US objections, with over 2,000 people killed in Israeli attacks across the country. Inintense clasheswith Hezbollah fighters several Israeli soldiers have also been killed. Israeli air strikes continue to pound Beirut. No condemnations are heard from Western governments of Israel’s aggressive actions on multiple fronts.\n\nMeanwhile, theWestern mediastill reports these developments from an extremely biased lens. Interviews with freed hostages and killings of Israeli soldiers receive prominent coverage, while the carnage and killings of thousands of innocent people in Gaza are mostly ignored, reinforcing the trend of the past year of dehumanising Palestinians.\nThe fate of the Middle East hangs in the balance as uncertainty abounds about Israel and Iran’s next moves in a highly fraught environment. The coming weeks will determine if a wider war can be avoided or whether the region will descend into a deadly regional conflagration."}]}

TheNew York Timesacknowledged that “Modi’s heavy manoeuvring to assert BJP ascendance was foiled”.\nNC leader Farooq Abdullah said, “The results were a ‘verdict’ against Modi’s government … [they] prove the steps taken on Aug 5 are not acceptable to the people.” Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, leader of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) declared: “By the vote people have rejected the unilateral changes imposed in August 2019, which led to their systematic disempowerment.”\nBefore assessing the electoral outcome, it is important to consider the backdrop in which the elections took place — after a decade. They occurred in the coercive presence of half a million Indiantroops deployedacross J&K, with additional forces inducted for the election that patrolled the streets and set up new checkpoints. APHC leaders continued to languish in jail or house detention. Curbs remained on the media with foreign journalists prevented from travelling to the region.\nThe unmistakable message of the electoral verdict was rejection of Modi’s post-2019 actions.\nA series of steps were taken by the BJP government after August 2019, including gerrymandering, aimed at manipulating and shaping the environment for the election. The electoral map was redrawn by carving out new constituencies to disempower the Muslim population. Jammu’s representation was increased to 43 seats leaving Kashmir with 47, despite the fact that the Valley’s population far exceeds Jammu’s.\n\nDemographic changes involved issuing domicile certificates to non-Kashmiri outsiders who became eligible to vote after abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A of the constitution. Temporary residents were also given voting rights. These measures were roundly denounced in J&K including by pro-India Kashmiri politicians and only deepened the resentment and alienation of the Kashmiri people. Little surprise then that issues of statehood, abrogation of Article 370 and New Delhi’s other measures that disenfranchised Kashmiris, dominated the election campaign.\nThe final blow came weeks before the election when the BJP government substantially increased the powers of the lieutenant-governor, nominated by New Delhi, to sharply limit the authority of the elected government. The LG, an instrument of direct rule by New Delhi since 2018, was given sweeping administrative and security powers and authority to nominate five members to the 90-member legislative assembly. This was condemned across Kashmir with political leaders describing it as an effort to reduce J&K to a municipality while NC leader Omar Abdullah said the chief minister’s office had been downgraded to “a powerless rubber stamp”. The Congress party called it the “murder of democracy”.\nThe election result was a reaction to these moves and above all to the state’s truncation and disempowerment. Significantly, there were no boycott calls. This reflected the public’s eagerness to use the ballot box to vent their protest against New Delhi as an act of resistance, especially as the election was seen as a referendum on the BJP government’s policies. The National Conference that won 42 seats out of 90 secured an absolute majority with its ally Congress, which won six seats. The Congress party’s ambiguous stance on Article 370 exacted a political price and eroded its support. All regional parties campaigned on promises to reverse the post-2019 changes.\n\nThe much speculated ‘wave’ in favour of independent candidates — a record number contested the election — failed to materialise with only two seats won by them in the Kashmir Valley. The People’s Democratic Party was decimated, winning only three seats with voters punishing it for its opportunistic alliance with the BJP in the past. The BJP failed to win a single seat from the 19 it contested in the Valley but secured 29, all from Jammu’s Hindu-majority districts. This underlined a more pronounced Hindu-Muslim divide in the region.\nThe National Conference was able to tap into popular anger with New Delhi by its unambiguous stand on statehood and autonomy. In its election manifesto the party pledged to fight for the restoration of Article 370, repeal all post-2019 laws that eroded Kashmir’s autonomy and work for India-Pakistan dialogue. Omar Abdullah, who will be the next chief minister, said after the election that his first order of business would be for the cabinet to adopt a resolution calling for restoration of statehood. He promised to keep “the conversation about Article 370 alive” but acknowledged that its restoration would be impossible under a BJP government. Nevertheless, his party’s victory was clear indication of Kashmiri rejection of New Delhi’s decisions as indeed the BJP’s narrative of bringing ‘development’ to J&K.\nOmar Abdullah will head a coalition government with Congress that will have very limited powers but face daunting challenges including a likely tussle with the LG. What is apparent is that BJP’s hopes that the election would end the debate over J&K’s status and enable Modi to ‘legitimise’ his 2019 action have been dashed.\nIn any case, an election under Indian occupation cannot serve as a substitute for a genuine exercise in self-determination by the Kashmiri people. Nor does the election alter in any way J&K’s disputed nature, embodied in UNSC resolutions. What the election does show is that whenever given a chance to voice their opinion the people of Kashmir always say they want no truck with New Delhi."}]}

He is one of the duo of journalists who exposed the Watergate scandal that led to president Richard Nixon’s downfall.\nWoodward has long enjoyed unique access to America’s top political and military leaders. Which is why he is sometimes unflatteringly described as an ’“access journalist” who shows undue deference to his main, often anonymous sources.\nHis latest book,War, belongs to the same genre as earlier works and is based on scores of interviews offering insights into the highest levels of decision-making during Joe Biden’s presidency. What gives this book added significance is its publication on the eve of the American presidential election, as he draws comparisons between Donald Trump and Biden in how they dealt with international crises.\n\nWoodward considers Trump as “the most reckless and impulsive president in American history”, who “is demonstrating the very same character as a presidential candidate in 2024”. He, therefore, deems Trump to be unfit for a second term in office. These views are no different from what Woodward previously wrote in his trilogy of books on the Trump presidency. The first two, titledFearandRage, were about the chaos in the Trump White House and depicted the former president as a self-obsessed, ill-informed and impetuous leader.\nThe principal focus of his new book is on how the Biden administration handled the wars in Ukraine andGaza, although Woodward’s disclosures about Trump’s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin — sending him Covid test kits when they were scarce at home — attracted greater pre-publication publicity for the book. War covers all these international engagements, but perhaps it is how theAmerican exit from Afghanistanwas botched up that might interest readers most in Pakistan.\nFor Biden, the 20-year US military presence in Afghanistan was “a classic case of mission creep” that he pledged in his election campaign to end. The mission had lost its purpose and direction and as vice president he warned president Barack Obama that he was being fed “bullshit” by military generals who were taking advantage of his inexperience. When Biden became president, he inherited the 2020 Doha agreement Trump concluded with the Taliban, which committed the US to withdraw from Afghanistan by May 2021.\nWoodward’s book reveals Biden’s advice was repeatedly ignored, yet US support for Israel remained firm.\nThree options were presented to Biden: stay on indefinitely, undertake a slower, “gated” withdrawal, or pull out quickly and safely. Like Trump, he wanted an expeditious out, and accordingly announced that in April 2021. Criticism followed from former military officials, and even ex-president George Bush. Biden remained undeterred. His administration, however, “failed to anticipate contingencies and plan for worst-case scenarios”, says Woodward. It was taken by surprise by how swiftly the country fell to the Taliban without a fight.\n\nBlaming the Afghan government and military for the debacle, Biden, however, stood by his decision while also passing the buck to Trump, saying he forged the original deal with the Taliban. None of this obscured the monumental intelligence failure that produced the chaotic exit, which had echoes of the US scramble from Vietnam. This inevitably damaged America’s global standing and credibility.\nThe chapters on the war in Gaza portray afrustrated US president, angry with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his constant lies about his intention to escalate the conflict, which Biden saw as inextricably linked to his political survival. “Defined by distrust”, their tense relationship is described in graphic detail. Woodward cites several occasions whenWashington’s advicewas willfully ignored, including on a ceasefire deal,Israel’s invasion of Rafah, siege of Gaza, air strikes on Beirut, and on avoiding civilian casualties. He quotes Biden as telling Netanyahu that “the perception of Israel around the world increasingly is that you’re a rogue state, a rogue actor”. He cites Biden’s frequent use of four-letter words for the Israeli leader.\nBiden wanted to contain the war to Gaza and, according to Woodward, told Netanyahu that the US is “not on board” on any preemptive attack on Hezbollah. He also told him Washington would not participate in any Israeli offensive action against Iran. He was concerned that 45,000 US military personnel and contractors stationed across the Middle East would become targets of attack. The book detailsheated argumentsbetween Biden and Netanyahu over humanitarian assistance for Gaza. The Israeli leader repeatedly responded to this by saying he will not allow “a drop or ounce to go into Gaza to help the people”. Netanyahu’s refusal to listen to Biden and unwillingness to provide urgent access for aid meant Washington failed to avert a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.\nDespite their many disagreements on the conduct of the war, Biden remained steadfast in his support of Israel. Whatever Woodward’s explanation of his inability to prevent Israel from escalating and broadening the war, this failure was a reflection of Washington’s strategic compulsion to avoid a rupture with Tel Aviv as well as the limits of a tired superpower’s eroding leverage, with a manipulative Netanyahu getting the better of a lame-duck Biden.\n\nThe role of key Arab states is highlighted in anecdotes of several meetings. For example, King Abdullah of Jordan tells US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, “We want Israel to defeat Hamas.” Similarly, the UAE ruler conveys to the Americans that “Hamas must be eliminated”. Saudi Arabia’s Crown PrinceMohammed bin Salmansays to Blinken in discussions on a future Palestinian state “Do I want it? It doesn’t matter that much. Do I need it? Absolutely”. Significantly, though, he added he would never betray the Arab or Muslim world on this issue.\nThe war in Ukraine also receives detailed treatment. The most striking disclosure concerns US intelligence information in September 2022 that Putin was considering using tactical nuclear weapons, and efforts by the Biden national security team to stop him. Direct US warnings to Russian officials are claimed by the book to have averted the danger of nuclear escalation.\nWhether or not one agrees with many of Woodward’s assessments and conclusions, this is a compelling, must-read book for its rich detail and insights into decision-making at the top echelons of the US government in times of war and crisis."}]}

But such media policing did nothing to obscure the grim reality of what had happened.\nAn anxious government along with its nervous political allies rushed through changes to the Constitution in the name of ‘parliamentary supremacy’, which fundamentally eroded the independence of the judiciary and made it subservient to the executive. The constitutional principle of the separation of powers was seriously undermined.\n\nThe most significant change is the government arrogating to itself the power tochoose the chief justicefrom a panel of three of the Supreme Court’s senior most judges. A parliamentary committee reflecting the government’s majority was empowered to nominate the CJ. This met quickly to select Yahya Afridi, the third judge on the seniority list, as chief justice —supersedingJustice Mansoor Ali Shah.\nAccording to the amendment,constitutional bencheswill be established comprising judges chosen by the Judicial Commission, whose composition has been changed, with a third now constituted by government nominees. This is aimed at enabling the government to determine which judges hear cases of concern to it. The Judicial Commission has also been empowered to undertake ‘annual performance evaluation’ of high court judges.\nPakistan’s history shows no government ever secured itself by such manoeuvres.\nThe reaction from much of the legal fraternity was rejection of the amendment as an extra-constitutional move that changed the Constitution’s basic structure and “strangled justice”.\nTheKarachi Bar Associationdenounced the amendment calling it a “direct attack” on judicial independence that could “obstruct access to justice for ordinary citizens”. Others saw it as a blow to democracy. Members of the legal communitycalled for protestsagainst the passage of the amendment.\nMeanwhile, theInternational Commission of Juristsdeclared “these changes bring an extraordinary level of political influence over the process of judicial appointments and the judiciary’s own administration”. And “they erode the judiciary’s capacity to independently and effectively function as a check against excesses by other branches of the state and protect human rights”. Similar concerns were voiced by the UN High Commissioner for Human RightsVolker Turkwho said the constitutional amendments would “seriously undermine independence of the judiciary.”\n\nWhat attracted widespread criticism was the haste with which the ruling party and its allies pushed for parliament to pass the amendments. Various drafts of the constitutional package were kept under wraps and the final version wasn’t even available to lawmakers before being tabled. Few read it. The public was kept in the dark with no effort made to take people into confidence. Barring a few speeches, no real debate took place in parliament.\nThe entire legislative process lacked transparency and was over in a few hours in both houses of parliament in the darkness of the night. Credible reports of officialcoercionto secure the required two-thirds vote further robbed the process of legitimacy. Aneditorialin theExpress Tribunecalled this a “manufactured” majority. Such criticism reinforced the opposition’s allegation that the government used dubious methods to get this done including intimidating legislators.\nWhat was behind this unseemly haste by the government? Obviously, theretirementof chief justice Qazi Faez Isa and the PML-N coalition’s intent to select his replacement. The government and its principal ally, the PPP, were fearful that the next chief justice could rule favourably on petitions or reviews of cases filed by the opposition PTI, possibly even order an audit of the February general election, which the party has long alleged was rigged.\nAlready thegovernment was reelingfrom the Supreme Court’sjudgmenton reserved parliamentary seats which, together with the Election Commission, it has been trying to thwart by refusing to implement the decision. The spectre of the next chief justice, if chosen by seniority, and who was fiercely independent and not compromised, seemed to unnerve the government.\n\nIt was apparent that political motives and not earnestness about judicial reform lay behind the government’s move, which had the full backing of, if not encouragement from, the establishment, also smarting over judicial rulings that had proved embarrassing for it.\nThe key question is whether the government has secured its political future by this amendment. As a general rule, power cannot be secured by undermining institutions, which has deleterious consequences that kick in sooner or later. Weakening checks and balances that limit arbitrary decisions has adverse implications for governance.\nIf Pakistan’s history is any guide no government has ever secured itself by such machinations. Ultimately, it is government performance and the legitimacy of its actions that guarantees its stability. Of course, our political history also shows that regardless of how a government acts, it is the establishment’s support or lack of it that determines its longevity. But the enabling factors for the establishment to withdraw its support from a government (or proactively move against it) are when it loses popularity and/or is governing poorly. In these circumstances, no legal or constitutional re-engineering can come to the aid of a government.\n\nThe bottom line is that nothing makes any government invincible and impervious to challenges to its power. Governments can and do engage in autocratic practices the world over in the mistaken belief that manipulation of the law,repression and coercive tacticswill help them consolidate and accumulate power. But resort to such measures and pursuit of unchecked power only shows how weak and vulnerable they really are, their lack of self-confidence as well as absence of faith in democratic processes and instruments.\nThe drama over the constitutional package has laid bare the lack of commitment of the ruling party and its political allies to democracy and democratic principles. Their undermining of judicial independence has left the country’s institutions poorer. It will also do little to secure their tenure. That depends on a host of other more consequential factors, especially government performance."}]}

Hereditary politics continues to hold sway, with power distributed among relatives by those who secure high office. The mould of dynastic politics was broken by the rise of PTI, but while its leader was not a dynast, the party included scions of influential political families.\nPakistan is no exception to a phenomenon witnessed across the world — of political families and dynasties dominating the political landscape. What are called political ‘nepo-babies’ are prominent almost everywhere. A political nepo-baby is generally defined as a beneficiary of nepotism — the offspring of someone who achieved high political office and ascends to power by virtue of that. The phenomenon also includes spouses or siblings who succeed in politics due to family connections.\nMany countries in Southeast Asia are governed by nepo-babies. Paetongtarn Shinawatra in Thailand, Bongbong Marcos in the Philippines, Hun Manet in Cambodia and Kim Jong Un in North Korea are all children of former rulers who now run their countries. Similarly, Indonesia’s vice president Gibran Rakabuming Raka is the son of former president Joko Widodo. Singapore was ruled for two decades by Lee Hsien Loong, son of Lee Kuan Yew, the country’s founder and first prime minister.\n\nIn South Asia, therecently oustedprime minister of Bangladesh, Hasina Wajid owed her political ascent to her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In India, three prime ministers came from the Nehru-Gandhi family; its scion Rahul Gandhi is now leader of the opposition. Latin America too has had its share of political families. Argentina has seen the Peróns and Kirchners. Former Uruguay president Jorge Luis Batlle came from a family of three presidents. Honduran President Xiomara Castro de Zelaya is the spouse of an ex-president.\nPolitical dynasties have also been a familiar phenomenon in the West. The Kennedys, Bushes and Clintons are prominent examples in the US. Then there is Justin Trudeau in Canada. In Europe, Estonia’s premier is the daughter of a former prime minister. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo and Marine Le Pen in France had politically famous parents.\nDynastic politics undermines institutions and the very notion of meritocracy.\nThe track record of nepo-babies has varied. Some have governed well, others not so. But there is no disagreement that however ‘qualified’ they may be, it is their family name that helped them attain power. Their privileged background gives them an advantage that runs counter to the very notion of a meritocracy. When the political playing field is skewed by their privileged DNA and offers unequal access to other political aspirants that doesn’t make political competition fair or equitable. This has adverse implications for democracy.\nA study of ‘Hereditary democracy’ by an Australian scholar Dr James Loxton emphasised its harmful impact on the political system. It found that mediocre leaders are more likely to rise to power when political office is limited to those with family connections in politics. In some cases, they even lack formal qualifications. Voters are also let down because when they elect relatives of famous politicians, they usually assume and expect similarities in leadership qualities or policies.\nHowever, elected progeny or relatives may differ substantially from their predecessors, leading to dashed voter expectations and poor representation. Anarticlepublished earlier this year inThe Economistsubtitled ‘Damaging dynasties’, argued that in several Asian countries, dynasts impeded economic growth because their interests and those of their cronies collided with the need for reform. Moreover, dynastic rule inhibits the building of strong institutions as personalities assume an outsized role and seek to dominate institutions, showing impatience with institutional checks on their power. They also prevent institutionalisation of their own political parties.\nWhy people vote for nepo-babies is an important question but has no uniform answer as political contexts and conditions vary from country to country. Generally speaking, name recognition and people’s familiarity with a well-known personality are important reasons for their support. As also their perception that the parent or relative of the political leader had earlier lived up to their expectations and his/her heir would bring stability. Dynastic leaders are also more prevalent in developing countries which have a political culture where politics is organised around patron-client networks and patronage oils the working of the political system.\nWhile every country with ruling dynasties has specific features,Pakistan’s caseis different from others in an important respect. As political interventions by the military have been pervasive throughout Pakistan’s history, it has often chosen to ally with one or the other political dynasty to counter a common political foe.\nThis has helped to shore up their position and revive their political fortunes even when public support for them has waned. They have also been vehicles to preserve the status quo. The two major political parties headed by dynasties are today favoured and bolstered by the establishment, as they serve as a counterpoise to Imran Khan’s PTI.\n\nThe two dynasty-led parties, PML-N and PPP have alternated in power for over four decades (when the military hasn’t assumed overt power). An assessment of how they governed has to be undertaken separately. Noteworthy here is that while the country has moved on, politics is still stuck in the old hereditary mode. Representative politics and the governance system are increasingly misaligned with the social and economic changes that have been reshaping the country’s landscape. These changes include greater urbanisation, shift in economic power from the countryside to the cities, expansion of a more assertive middle class, emergence of a diverse civil society and a more ‘connected’ and informed citizenry, thanks to the spread of technology.\nThese changes are creating different public expectations and aspirations. The growing middle class wants to see a meritocratic political system free from domination by dynasties that are seen to represent the past, not the future. The key question is whether this growing mismatch between the demands of a rising middle class and family or clan-dominated politics can unleash dynamics that ultimately yield more competent and accountable governance."}]}

And it is a stunning comeback. His clean sweep in the election, winning the White House, Senate and most likely the House of Representatives, will make him a more powerful president than he was in his first term, with a stronger mandate.\nWhat his foreign policy will look like is being feverishly assessed across the world. Will it mimic his first term’sAmerica First approachwhich translated into an America Alone policy? Will it prove as disruptive and destabilising as in the past?\nInfluencing assessments is the widespread view among the international community that Washington’s engagement with the world in recent years has neither been sustained nor consistent, which raises questions about US reliability. This at a time when the US is no longer the sole dominant power in an increasingly multipolar world, which places limits on its ability to shape global geopolitics and determine outcomes.\n\nTrump’s unpredictable and impulsive personality will intensify uncertainty about the course of American policy especially given his penchant for suddenly changing course. His ‘America First’ unilateralist worldview created much discontinuity and volatility in foreign policy in his first term and dented America’s international standing. His isolationist approach also made the US retrench from its global role.\nOne certainty, with far-reaching implications for global stability and economy, is that Trump 2.0 will continue the well-established US policy ofcontainment of China. A bipartisan consensus now sees China as a strategic adversary and challenge. Trump might escalate the confrontation over trade and technology issues. During the campaign he threatened to impose60 per cent tariffsacross the board on Chinese imports and end China’s most favoured-nation status. Whether he raises tariffs to this extent is doubtful as he will have to calculate its impact on American consumers; costlier imports would push up prices and that too when inflation is a challenge. It would also pose a risk to European economies as China is Europe’s biggest trading partner.\nDuring the campaign, Trump also said he would seek a good relationship with Beijing. In aFox Newsinterview, he said while there was no greater critic of China than him, he respected China and President Xi Jinping. Though Trump will take a tough position on trade issues, his business instincts will urge him to be transactional and open to striking deals with China on trade and perhaps other contentious issues, includingTaiwan. While intensifying the rivalry with China, Trump would want to avoid a collision course or military conflict over Taiwan. He has, in fact, been critical of Taiwan, saying it should pay the US for defending it.\nDisruptions in US policy are likely at a time when the world is already in a state of chaos.\nTrump has proposed a 10 to 20pc tariff on all imported goods, which will strain relations with America’s European allies, who Trump treated with derision in his first term, casting them as free-loaders. Aimed at all countries that have a trade surplus with the US, this would nonetheless be hard to implement. It would be a blow to developing economies and dampen global economic growth.\n\nWhile Trump is an avowed protectionist, the question is how far he will go to press this agenda. According to economic experts, his plan to raise tariffs and order mass deportations of immigrants will further fuelinflationthat Trump has promised to tackle.\nWhere a radical change in US policy is likely is on theUkraine war. Often claiming he can end the war “in a day”, Trump is expected to push for talks to end a conflict he says “should never have happened”. This is cause for concern for Europe. Trump has said he will press Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin to enter negotiations for a peace deal. He may not be averse to an outcome that favours Moscow in which Ukraine has to cede territory. He is unlikely to respond to reservations of European nations in this regard.\nTrump has frequently chastisedNatoallies for not sharing the defence burden. He has also said in his second term, America will fundamentally rethink “Nato’spurpose and mission” and ask European nations to reimburse the US billions of dollars for military supplies it sent to Ukraine. This may be bluster but there is little doubt that Trump and the Republican Party do not want to continue military funding to Ukraine.\nEuropean allies, therefore, have much to worry about. They have to deal with a president who has shown little commitment to European security, and who declared during the campaign that “in many cases, our allies are worse than our so-called enemies”. Trump sees European countries not contributing enough to their own security and taking advantage of the US, a situation he wants to end. He has no patience with alliances. Or with multilateralism.\n\nThe crisis in the Middle East presents a clear and present challenge that Trump might seek to address by forcing a ceasefire in Gaza. Whileavoiding specifics, he repeatedly said during the campaign he wants to see peace in the region and Israel should end the war quickly — by winning it and “finishing the job”. He is evenmore pro-Israelthan President Joe Biden and has no empathy for the plight of the Palestinians (Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu once called Trump the best friend Israel ever had in the White House).\nNor has Trump shown any commitment to a two-state solution even though that remains the US position. Any deal he might push for will be on Israel’s terms and will also aim to goad other Arab countries to accede to theAbraham Accords— his signature Middle East initiative in his first term. This will principally involve encouraging Saudi Arabia to normalise ties with Israel, although Riyadh has made it clear this will only be possible once a Palestinian state is established.\nUnpredictability is likely to be the hallmark of Trump’s foreign policy. But because he has a transactional view of international relations that would also open his policies to pragmatic possibilities. The world can expect disruptions in US policy at a pivotal time when wars and crises hang in the balance in what UN Secretary General António Guterres calls an “age of chaos”."}]}

Instead, subsequent developments indicate the long-standing diplomatic impasse persists and may even have deepened.\nThe speculation was sparked by the visit to Islamabad last month of S. Jaishankar to attend the meeting of the 10-member Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the first by an Indian foreign minister in over a decade. But he made clear ahead of the trip thatno bilateral engagementwas envisioned. Nor did Islamabad seek a meeting on the sidelines. The media noise over the customary exchange ofhandshakes and pleasantriesdid not obscure the reality that Jaishankar’s 24-hour stay did nothing to break the diplomatic deadlock — and wasn’t intended to.\n\nIn fact, overtures to New Delhi by former prime minister and head of the ruling party Nawaz Sharif and his daughter, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, elicited no response from the Indian government.\nNawaz Sharif said he saw Jaishankar’s visit as apositive signthat might lead to improved relations and hoped the two countries would restore sports and trade ties. Maryam Nawaz publicly called for “climate diplomacy” with India to deal with the growing challenge of smog on both sides of the Punjab border. This was met by silence from New Delhi. But the chief minister of Indian PunjabridiculedMaryam’s claim that smog from the Indian side was reaching Lahore.\nExpectations that sports would help to pave the way for a thaw did not materialise. Althoughcricket diplomacyhas played a part in the past to ease tensions and bring the two countries closer, not so this time. Despite informally conveyed urgings by Pakistani officials, Indiaannouncedit would not send its cricket team to play in Pakistan for the eight-nation Champions Trophy, which Pakistan will host in February/ March 2025.\nThe Indian cricket board apparently cited security concerns for its decision. For their part, Pakistani officials rejected the Indian suggestion to play their matches in Dubai or elsewhere and ruled out any ‘hybrid solution’. The row continues.\nRecent developments are not encouraging for India-Pakistan diplomatic re-engagement.\nMeanwhile, to add to disputes between the two countries, in late August, New Delhi formally asked Islamabad for areview of the Indus Waters Treaty. The 1960 treaty, brokered by the World Bank, has for over six decades survived wars, confrontations and tensions to provide a framework that governs the sharing and management of trans-border rivers. The fate of the treaty may now be at risk due to India’s insistence on modifying it on grounds of what it calls “fundamental and unforeseen change” in circumstances as well as security concerns.\n\nThe latest communication follows an earlier one inJanuary 2023, when India notified Islamabad of its intention to amend the treaty’s dispute settlement provisions. According to Indian mediareports, the latest one includes India’s concerns over issues such as “demographic changes, environmental challenges, and the need to accelerate clean energy development”.\nIslamabadrespondedby a terse statement expressing willingness to discuss any concerns in the relevant body, the joint Indus Waters Commission, while calling on India to comply with the treaty. The two countries have disagreed in recent years over the treaty’s dispute settlement mechanism; India boycotted a court of arbitration hearing in January 2023 at the Hague on Indian hydroelectric projects on the Chenab and Jhelum rivers disputed by water-stressed Pakistan.\nThese developments do not create a propitious climate for India-Pakistan diplomatic re-engagement. But the biggest obstacle is India’s obduraterefusalto discuss the Kashmir dispute. Relations, in fact, were ruptured inAugust 2019when India illegally annexed, bifurcated and absorbed the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir into the Indian union — in violation and defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. Formal dialogue and the peace process were suspended by India long before this. But Delhi’s 2019 action, accompanied by a sweeping set of repressive measures, prompted Pakistan to suspend trade and downgrade diplomatic ties by recalling its high commissioner.\n\nThe Modi government’s post-2019 actions in J&K only intensified tensions with Pakistan. Ignoring Islamabad’s protests, it undertook a slew of far-reaching legal,demographic, and electoral changesin occupied Kashmir aimed at disempowering Kashmiri Muslims. This further vitiated the regional climate and left ties more fraught. In a bid to consolidate and ‘legitimise’ its August 2019 action, the Modi government allowedelections to be heldto the J&K assembly in September/ October — after a decade — but only after truncating the powers and authority of the ‘elected’ government by substantially empowering the lieutenant-governor, nominated by Delhi.\nThis was opposed by all Kashmiri parties and showed the Modi government had no intention to cede central control of J&K. The outcome of the election was a rebuke to the BJP and rejection of its 2019 action that robbed the state of even its nominal autonomy.\nBJP’s hopes that the election would end the debate over J&K’s status were dashed. Another setback for the Modi government came when the newly elected assembly met andadopted a resolutioncalling for restoration of the state’s pre-2019 special status. Opposing this in a rowdy session, BJP lawmakers clashed with other legislators and had to be expelled from the chamber for disrupting the proceedings.Respondingto the assembly’s demand, Prime Minister Modi declared no power in the world could restore J&K’s partial autonomy and that he had “buried the wall of Article 370 in the graveyard”.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, formidable difficulties persist in the path of normalisation of ties between India and Pakistan. India’s refusal to even discuss Kashmir is a major impediment to resumption of any dialogue. Indian leaders claim they have ‘settled’ the Kashmir dispute and there is nothing to negotiate with Pakistan. In August, Jaishankar declared the era of “uninterrupted dialogue” with Pakistan is over … So far as J&K is concerned, Article 370 is done“.\nThe Modi government has shown no interest in resuming talks with Islamabad even on other issues, including trade, preferring to maintain a strategic freeze on relations with Pakistan. It has apparently concluded that this only hurts Pakistan and not India. This makes the outlook for Pakistan-India relations uncertain as well as bleak."}]}

That being the state of play today, what does it all indicate? It speaks of a siege mentality on the part of the government and establishment — a state in which they see themselves in constant danger and fearful all the time of being overwhelmed by opponents. This urges them to take strong-arm measures, not occasionally but incessantly.\nStrong-arm actions do not signify a strong government. Instead, they signal weakness, a lack of self-confidence and, above all, a failure to address a political challenge by political means. It lays bare a government unsure of itself that has no political solution to a political problem. This, some would say, is not new and merely a throwback to past periods of repression and use of high-handed tactics from a familiar playbook. That may be so although one can argue that the present scale of authoritarian actions go much further than those witnessed under a civilian government before.\nBut the more important question is what it signifies about the present ruling hybrid coalition. When measures aimed to contain the opposition and dissenting voices involve the government routinely locking itself up, laying siege to itself and shutting itself off from ground realities, what does that really say? It reflects a government that desperately seeks to preserve power but implicitly acknowledges it does not have popular support or legitimacy and can only deal with opponents by using the state’s machinery of repression. It also tries to over-insure itself by efforts to control the streets, courts, parliament, media and the digital space.\nThe irony is that the more authorities try to control the more they feel they need to but the less they are able to. It becomes an endless game of whack-a-mole in which the presumed gains are transient and keep warranting more actions without any assurance of success in subduing the opposition or stifling criticism. A siege mentality has wide-ranging implications — for governance, politics, economy and for international perceptions of the country.\nStrong-arm actions do not signify a strong government.\nThe implication for governance of a ‘siege mindset’ is that it preoccupies the ruling coalition at the expense of focusing on its actual obligations. The insecurity it engenders becomes a fatal distraction from governance as it involves constantly directing its attention and energy to confronting opponents and instituting measures to control them. Much of the narrative emanating from government ministers is more about the opposition’s ‘malign’ conduct, than about public policy or what they are delivering. Government performance suffers from an obsessive concern with seeking to upend and defeat opponents.\nThe political impact of a siege mentality has been no less deleterious. It has led to efforts to undermine institutions, curb their independence and weaken democracy itself. This has been evidenced by the way the ruling coalition has reduced parliament to a rubber stamp. Fearful of open debate, parliamentary proceedings have seen repeated attempts to muzzle opposition and critical voices. When the Speaker, otherwise acting as a pawn of the ruling party, is compelled to give opposition members an opportunity to speak, television channels are ‘advised’ to ignore or censor their remarks. Consequential legislation has been adopted without discussion — the 26th Constitutional Amendment being the latest case in point. Failure toimplementthe Supreme Court judgment onallocationof reserved seats to PTI is the most egregious example of the ruling coalition’s insecurity that has left parliament denuded of representative credentials and therefore legitimacy. Consequently, public confidence in parliamentary institutions has sunk to a new low.\nA siege mentality regards independent institutions of any kind as a threat and danger. Such insecurity prompted the government to mount an assault on judicial independence. The constitutional amendment rammed through parliament by a panicky government fundamentally eroded the independence of the judiciary by making it subservient to the executive. The constitutional principle of the separation of powers was cast aside by a government afraid of unfavourable court verdicts.\nThe economic impact on an ailing economy is also significant. Frequent shutdowns and blockades of cities obviously hits businesses hard. Apart from working days lost to such lockdowns, delays in delivery of production material and export items exact a heavy economic price. Then there is thecostto the exchequer of deploying thousands of security forces to police the streets and renting shipping containers to prevent demonstrators from reaching their destination. This is estimated to run into millions of rupees.\nThe impact of internet disruptions and restrictions has also been far reaching. Again, there are economic costs of such actions for e-commerce and businesses that depend on the internet for their operation. The disruptions pose obvious difficulties for Pakistan’s burgeoning IT industry and sizeable online freelance workforce. This has prompted warnings from industry representatives such as the Pakistan Software Houses Association that the internet slowdown and blocking of VPNs would cripple the digital economy and become an “existential threat” for the IT industry.\nAn American expert from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation recently warned about the long-term risks to the economy by internet interruptions. These disruptions also block people’s access to financial, health and emergency services.\nInternational perceptions of the country are adversely affected by all of the above. Frequent shutdowns of cities and businesses, internet controls and roads littered with containers convey an image of the country as unstable, insecure and unpredictable. This does nothing to encourage foreign investors; instead, it deters them. With businesses facing many obstacles and having to close down so often the country doesn’t appear to outsiders to be safe enough to do business in. Thus, the reputational damage to the country is immense.\nAll this should be reason for the government to review its authoritarian conduct and assess the damage its siege mentality is doing to the country. Above all, it should understand that it cannot secure itself in power by weakening institutions, restricting public access to the internet and taking undemocratic actions to curb the freedom of expression and people’s right to protest."}]}

Tensions still run high. The use of force by the government and its establishment backers ultimately dispersed the protesters mobilised by Imran Khan’s PTI, with its leaders fleeing the capital for their stronghold in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. But that may only be a temporary reprieve for the ruling coalition.\nTo be sure, PTI failed to achieve its goal. The way its supporters retreated was a setback for the party and exposed its lack of strategy. The eruption ofinternal differencesmade matters worse. Party disarray was further reflected by theresignationof its secretary general Salman Akram Raja. But the episode also left the government damaged.\n\nThesiege of the capitalordered by a panicky government, barricades erected to prevent demonstrators from entering the city, cutting Punjab off from Islamabad, curbs on media reporting as well as internet and mobile phone servicedisruptionsall laid bare the government’s shakiness and failure to handle the situation by political means.\nThecrackdownon demonstrators to break up the protests involved excessive use of force that left scores injured. Severalprotesters were killed, which the media was banned from reporting with hospital authorities coerced into silence. PTI leaders claimed many supporters were killed but government ministersdenied thisand instead congratulated themselves for quelling the protests. Over1,000 demonstrators were arrestedin Islamabad while a sweeping clampdown on party activists continued acrossPunjab. A journalist investigating the deaths of protesters wasarrestedon charges of terrorism and possessing narcotics.\nAll this undermined the government’s credibility. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan called for the “immediate and unconditional release” of the journalist, as did the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\nThe crackdown prompted the president of the Supreme Court Bar Association to issue a statementcondemning“the brutal and reprehensible handling of civilian protesters which resulted in the heavy loss of numerous lives”. It also noted “bullets were directly fired on unarmed protesters”.Amnesty Internationalcalled for “an urgent and transparent investigation” into the “deadly crackdown”.\nTheeconomic damagehas also been incalculable. How can the country be seen as a safe or attractive destination for investment with violent clashes on the streets of the capital?\nMoreover, the prospect of more rounds of government-opposition confrontations indicated by the ongoing war of words, does little to build or revive business confidence. Political uncertainty and fears of more unrest obviously vitiates the business climate. This at a time when economic recovery remains tentative and fragile with structural problems of the economy yet to be addressed.\nCrushing a protest doesn’t mean establishing political stability.\nCrushing a protest doesn’t mean establishing political stability. The danger, indicated by the government’s triumphal mood, is that the ruling coalition may imposegovernor’s rule in KPto deliver a ‘final’ blow to PTI. This possibility was strengthened when many ministers recommended governor’s rule in a cabinet meeting last week. The government apparently plans to consult allies before taking a final decision. Although imposing governor’s rule is a complicated political and legal process, it would be a disastrous move if it happens.\n\nRemoving an elected government in a province where it enjoys an overwhelming parliamentary majority and public support would not just be a blow to democracy and federalism. It would provoke public anger and lead to widespread alienation even unrest in the province similar to that witnessed in Balochistan. This would make it difficult for any arrangement foisted on the province to govern. It would have an exceedingly adverse impact on managing the insurgency in KP and resolving sectarian tensions that continue to erupt inviolence in the Kurram region. Already 100 people have died in clashes.\nPTI leaders say theirprotests will continuewith KP chief minister warning the party won’t back down in the face of threats to impose governor’s rule or emergency. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called PTI a “terrorist group” and warned of tough measures ahead. This indicates a state of denial about the widespread public discontent that fuels repeated protests. But what does all this mean for the democratic system and the country? Can anything be done to reduce political tensions?\nDemocratic backslidingis apparent with parliament rendered irrelevant and the political system becoming increasingly dysfunctional. Recent developments also signify a breakdown of politics because a political problem is not being tackled by deploying a political solution.\nThere is no way out of the present turmoil except through serious negotiations that can produce an agreement to de-escalate political tensions that are taking such a heavy toll on the country. Political reconciliation may be a bridge too far given the absence of trust between the government and opposition. But both sides need to step back and come to some kind of modus vivendi for the sake of the country.\nTo achieve a political settlement, the government would have to cease its repressive measures, withdraw frivolous cases against opposition leaders, end policing the media, release those incarcerated for bailable ‘offences’ as well as free thousands of PTI activists recently taken into custody. It should also implement the Supreme Court judgement on allocation of reserved seats. This would incentivise PTI to fight their battle in parliament rather than on the streets.\n\nFor its part, PTI would have to suspend itsagitational politicsand refrain from disruptive conduct in and outside parliament. Its chief minister in KP should commit to running his province rather than leading protest rallies. Such a compromise may seem unrealistic in the present fraught environment but the alternative is more turmoil and uncertainty.\nIn the past, an arbiter was always needed to arrive at a truce between warring political sides in order to end a political crisis. That role was traditionally played by the military. But today, it is seen to have adopted a stance that denudes it from playing the role of a neutral arbiter. The question is whether in the interest of domestic peace and stability it is prepared to revisit that stance and help end what has become a perpetual political confrontation."}]}

Is the country experiencing significant democratic erosion? Is this different from the past? Pakistan doesn’t, after all, have an edifying democratic record.\nThe sweep of its tangled history presents a picture of democratic reversals and governance failures. Its search for a viable political order that can provide a stable environment to meet national challenges has been elusive. A troubled political past has seen the country swing between long bouts ofmilitary ruleand short-lived, fragile democratic governments.\nIn periods of civilian rule, the military establishment continued to exercise significant political influence. The post-1988revival of democracyand subsequent ‘democratic decade’ sawinterventionsby the military-backed president to repeatedly oust elected governments with none able to complete their term.\nBitter feuds between political rivals and lack of tolerance for the opposition enabled the establishment to manipulate politics and undercut democratic rule. It easily enlisted the aggrieved political party of the time to support its interventions. Almost every party played this game in pursuit of power and actively sought such interventions against its adversary, reinforcing the military’s dominance.\n\nThe democratic phase that began in 2008, after president Pervez Musharraf wasforced to step down, set a better record with political leaders showing mutual tolerance, greater respect for civil liberties and allowing the media to function fairly independently in a relatively open environment. The 2018 election, however, ushered in a period of hybrid rule that saw the military acquire a more prominent role and emerge as virtual co-partners in governance.\nAnother phase began with theremovalof Imran Khan’s government in 2022. This paved the way for the establishment to assume the most expansive role yet in an ostensibly civilian set-up. The past two years have seen a decisive shift in the civil-military power balance in the latter’s favour, with its role in governance even extending to economic policy.\nThis is unprecedented even by the country’s past record of the military’s sway over government affairs. This is because it is involved in far more areas of governance as well as playing an active role in ‘political management’ including influencing parliamentary business and countering Khan’s party.\nProspects of political stability are clouded by Pakistan’s increasing autocratisation.\nThe currentdemocratic declineis also reflected in authoritarian measures directed against the opposition and other critics. Another significant indicator of democratic regression is undermining the independence of institutions that can check executive power, notably thejudiciaryand Election Commission. It has also involveddefianceof Supreme Court orders. All this has turned the country into an electoral autocracy, where the shell of democracy remains but is increasingly shorn of substance.\n\nElectoral autocracies are generally described as hybrid regimes in which democratic institutions are extensively compromised and that use authoritarian or repressive methods to rule. Elections take place but their fairness is doubted while fundamental requisites of democracy such as freedom of association, assembly and expression are either not met or partially met. It is noteworthy that in its annual democracy index, that evaluates the health of democracy around the world, theEconomist Intelligence Unitchanged Pakistan’s classification from a hybrid regime to an authoritarian regime.\nSome would argue the present state of play in Pakistan is really more of the same, indistinguishable from the past. Previous periods of civilian rule also saw undemocratic conduct by elected governments, intolerance of opposition, jailing of opposition leaders on trumped-up charges, marginalisation of parliament and efforts to curb press freedom and undermine judicial independence. They also saw the military establishment backing one political party against others and exercising significant influence over the political system. This is all true.\nWhile the present situation has several past features, the scale and intensity of democratic backsliding makes it different today. For example, in the past the military would help or back a favoured political party’s ascent to power, but then mostly retreat from the political arena to concern itself with its core interests — national security and foreign policy. This provided some space for democratic institutions to function even if imperfectly. Importantly, this preserved its critical role as an arbiter — a role it could play when a political crisis needed to be resolved. Its present stance limits its ability to play that role today.\nCivilian governments in the past would persecute political opponents and take other measures including controlling the media and manipulating parliament, but they would do so mostly on their own without the establishment’s direct involvement.\n\nThat changed after 2018 and even more after 2022. The establishment became directly involved in efforts to ‘control’ the opposition, media, digital space and courts. This expanded their sphere of active involvement in an unprecedented way. A key reason was that the political set-upinstalledafter the February election hadlimited public supportand political heft which ‘necessitated’ a more active support role by the establishment.\nPrevious periods of civilian democracy did not see continuous bans on political protests and public assembly so frequent now. Nor did they see the constant ‘containerisation’ of protests andbarricading of cities. Moreover, targeting of political opponents is now accompanied by efforts at broa­der repression. Because there is more to control, especially social media, the present government has gone much further than its civilian predecessors in imposingdigital space restrictionsand censorship and micromanaging the electronic media.Laws to criminalise criticismon digital platforms are on the anvil in further tightening of controls.\nTelevision channels are now told what not to broadcast and even who to invite as commentators. Undeclaredmedia curbshave involved restrictions on how and who to cover in the opposition.\nMore recently, curbs have entailed the government barring TV channels from reportingcivilian casualtiesin opposition protests in Islamabad that were quelled by the overwhelming use of force.Raidson opposition leaders’ homes, traumatisation of opponents’ relatives and incommunicado detention of party activists are also part of the government’s current inventory of repressive actions.\nPakistan’s democratic future and prospects of political stability are clouded by increasing autocratisation. To those who believe stability can be achieved at the cost of democratic freedoms, Pakistan’s history is testimony to the fact that this is a dangerous self-serving fallacy."}]}

Public optimism remained in short supply. AnIpsos pollat year-end found nearly 80 per cent of people felt the country was headed in the wrong direction.\nThe outgoing year left many unresolved challenges for 2025. They include an unending government-oppositionconfrontation,resurgencein militant violence, and afragile economyyet to make the transition from tenuous stabilisation to sustainable recovery and growth.\n\nThe year began with a disputed general election whose repercussions reverberated throughout the year. Hopes that the February election would lead to political stability didn’t materialise. Instead, allegations of ballotirregularities and fraudtriggered protests and set the stage for political battles that were also fought in the courts. The election produced a fractured mandate and a hung parliament that sent major parties scrambling to cobble a majority.\nDespite the obstacles placed in its path, including jailing its top leaders and denial of an election symbol, Imran Khan’s PTIwon the largest shareof seats to emerge as the single largest bloc in the National Assembly. But it wasn’t accepted as the winner by the other two major parties. Instead, helped by the establishment, they joined hands to ensure PML-N formed a coalition government comprising six parties and headed by Shehbaz Sharif, with PPP’s backing.\nDependent on PPP and other allies for its majority and with its legitimacy in question, the Sharif government neither exhibited the confidence nor the sure-footedness usually expected of a newly elected government. That only increased its dependence on the establishment, to which Sharif conceded even more ground. This enabled the military to secure the most expansive role yet in a civilian set-up.\n\nThe post-2018 hybrid governing arrangement morphed into one in which the military became directly involved in multiple spheres of governance including theeconomyas well as in efforts to counter PTI.\nThe decisive shift in the power balance to the military was also reflected in adoption of legislation by the ruling coalition that extended the tenures of military chiefs from three to five years and to another five years in the period of their extension and reappointment.\nPublic optimism was in short supply at a time of political turmoil and economic stress.\nWhile fierce government-opposition confrontations kept the ruling alliance unsettled, PTI was unable by its several street protests to mount enough pressure to achieve its goals, including the release of Imran Khan. Its claim to reserved seats in parliament, which wasupheld by the Supreme Court, would have fundamentally changed thepolitical equation. But it was denied by the government in defiance of the court order. Other court verdicts also made the government nervous and insecure.\nThis prompted it to rush through constitutional changes in parliament, which fundamentally eroded the independence of the judiciary and made it subservient to the executive. The26th Constitutional Amendmentarrogated to the government the power to choose the chief justice, which it did byappointing Yahya Afridi, casting aside the seniority principle. Also undermined was the constitutional principle of the separation of powers by a government fearful of unfavourable court verdicts.\n\nThe more consequential issue dominating the year was management of an ailing economy still in the critical ward. In September, following tough negotiations, the Sharif government secured a much-needed$7 billion loan packagefrom the IMF after meeting several conditionalities to impose fiscal discipline, limit subsidies and undertake tax and austerity measures. This marked Pakistan’s 25th IMF bailout programme and committed the government toreforms, but without addressing the critical issue of the country’s growing debt burden.\nWith the danger of default averted, government measures helped to restore a modicum of macroeconomic stability by reining in the fiscal deficit, building foreign exchange reserves and curbing inflation. But the economy’s structural weaknesses remained unaddressed especially unsustainable debt.\nThe biggest economic challenge persisted: making the transition from stabilisation to growth and investment. This required a stable and predictable political environment. But the government seem­­ed unwilling to recognise that political turmoil and uncertainty put at risk any sustainable economic recovery and a path to growth. The question for the year ahead is whether efforts will be made to de-escalate political tensions and create an en­­viro­n­ment conducive for investment. Stabilisation alone has not proved convincing enough for investors.\n\nThe outgoing year saw significant deterioration in the security situation by a surge in terrorist and militant violence across KP and Balochistan. Terrorism-related fatalities kept rising throughout the year, witharound 1,000 lives lostof civilians and law-enforcement personnel. The Baloch Liberation Army was seen to have become as big a security threat as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.Augustwas a particularly deadly month, with close to 100 people killed in militant attacks in the two insurgency-afflicted provinces. Violence in KP’s Kurram district claimed nearly 200 lives inNovember. Sectarian tensions there remain unresolved despite tenuous government-brokered peace deals.\nThe government’s foreign policy in 2024 was characterised by drift and lacked any strategic direction. The government celebrated Islamabad’shosting a summitof the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation as a foreign policy ‘win’, as well as the prime minister’s innumerable overseas trips even though they produced no outcomes.\nPakis­tan’s two critical bilateral relationships — with China and the US — faced challenges, for different reasons. The killing of Chinese nationals in several terrorist incidents injectedstrains in relationswith Pakistan’s closest ally and biggest investor, urging top Chinese officials to warn security issues could threaten CPEC’s future.\n\nRelations with the US remained at inflection point, with low-level diplomatic engagement reflecting Pakistan’s diminished geopolitical importance for Washing­ton. Once an active diplomatic player in the Mid­dle East, Islamabad’s principal engagement with the region was toseek loansfrom rich Arab countries. In the neighbourhood, Pakistan faced troubled relations in varying degrees with all three neighbours. Its biggest regional setback was deterioration inrelations with Kabul, which remained unresponsive to Pakistan’s security concerns despite Islamabad’s resort to coercive measures.\nThis makes 2025 a year when critical challenges both on the domestic and foreign policy front will need to be purposefully and competently addressed."}]}

A national compact is needed that reflects political consensus on the following key issue areas.\nConsensual democracy:Political stability requires consensus not just on the continuance of democracy but also its functioning on the basis of respect for fundamental freedoms, tolerance and mutual accommodation. Consensual democracy should be distinguished from majoritarian democracy, which concentrates power in the hands of the majority. Consensual democracy means sharing power in an inclusive system. The federal nature of Pakistan’s polity makes this imperative. As also the fact that the last five elections produced hung parliaments and did not deliver a majority to any party. This necessitated coalition governments.\nThe party that emerged as the single largest to lead coalitions won roughly a third or less of the popular vote in these elections. Therefore, the assumption that the winning party is the ‘sole representative’ of the people must be discarded. Instead, it should be accepted that its mandate is qualified as other parties too have significant electoral support and should be engaged in the working of the political system. A ‘winner-takes-all’ stance leads to inherently unstable, exclusionary governance.\nThe regional nature of electoral outcomes, which leaves provinces in the hands of political parties different from the one controlling the centre, also warrants an accommodative approach. The federal government has to work with and not against opposition-run provinces to build inter-provincial consensus on major issues. While the central government can enact laws and take policy measures, their enforcement requires the consent of all provinces.\nPolitical leaders should rise above their narrow interests to evolve a consensus on core issues.\nRole of the military:The military’s role is another core area needing agreement. A firm popular consensus already exists that elected representatives should be in charge of governance. But this has not been fully translated into reality. The hybrid system today is one in which the military exercises significant informal power over governance, the most expansive under any civilian government. Civil-military rebalancing of power is needed to align it with democratic principles and public aspirations. Political leaders should commit not to drag the army into politics to fight their battles. The military should respect the principle of civilian supremacy, even if on security policy and some aspects of foreign policy it will continue to have an important voice.\nEconomic rebound and growth:Agreement on fundamental economic reforms is integral to a national compact. An IMFbailout, with Pakistan now in its 25th loan programme, is necessary for stabilisation but no substitute for a broader home-grown economic plan that charts a sustainable path to growth. Only by fixing structural problems can the vicious cycle be ended of high budget and balance-of-payments deficits and chronic foreign exchange crises that have led to repeated IMF bailouts.\nShort-lived growth booms predicated on domestic and foreign borrowing are unviable. Such a flawed model must be abandoned. Instead, structural reforms have to be undertaken to widen the tax base, diversify exports, promote investment, privatise loss-making state-owned enterprises and boost productivity. The elements of such reforms are well known and should be agreed to by all stakeholders. A key objective should be the country’s integration into global production and supply chains. Consensus should also extend to rightsizing the huge and bloated government apparatus.\nHuman development:Investment in human development should be a key component of a national compact. Most indicators of literacy, education, health and other aspects of human welfare have deteriorated in recent years with povertyrisingto almost 40 per cent. Pakistan cannot achieve economic growth and progress by failing to invest in its people.\nFailure on this count has already relegated the country to the bottom of global human development rankings. Underinvestment has meant 40pc of Pakistanis remain illiterate while almost 26 million school-age children are out of school. This is a national scandal. Health indicators remain grim. An alarming consequence of malnutrition is widespread child stunting. Population planning and efforts to reduce the fertility rate are needed for Pakistan to avert a demographic disaster from spiralling population numbers.\nInstitutional reform:The instruments of governance have long been in disrepair and need to be fixed. The erosion of the state’s institutional capacity is reflected in deterioration in public service delivery. This decline is the cumulative result of several factors among which two stand out: postponed reforms and politicisation of the civil service. Reform of the civil service is therefore urgent. Unless an outdated and dysfunctional institution is made fit for purpose the most well-conceived government policies cannot be effectively implemented. This requires comprehensive reform, not just piecemeal tinkering. A systemic problem needs a systemic response.\nDefeating militancy and terrorism:Theresurgenceof terrorist violence requires a comprehensive, whole-of-government response not periodic announcements of military operations in insurgency-hit areas every time there is a major incident. Although important gains have been made over the years in counterterrorism efforts, measures have been patchy and episodic with an over-emphasis on kinetic actions. Police and civilian law-enforcement agencies remain under-resou­rced and need major retooling.\nA fresh multipronged action plan should be crafted to addr­ess the various dimensions of the threat including cracking down on terror financing and improved coordination between intelligence and law-enforcement agencies. This should also involve a strategy to secure the support of local communities for the plan’s enforcement. The plan should deal with the ideological and political aspects of the challenge of violent extremism.\nThese are not the only challenges facing the country but the most critical which warrant priority attention and mobilisation of a national consensus on how to address them. This is difficult but not impossible. It needs strong political will from a leadership that looks within and not outside to solve the country’s problems. Above all, it needs a leadership that puts the country’s interests before its own."}]}

Heightened geopolitical tensions, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and uncertainties in the global risk environment make the international outlook a troubled one for the year ahead.\nThe global order has been fragmenting for some time now. Meanwhile, the shift to a more multipolar world is gathering pace, with Western dominance eroding and multilateral institutions coming under greater stress.Middle powerswill play a growing role in shaping geopolitics in a landscape of changes in the global balance of power.\nOne of the biggest questions for 2025 is whether president-elect Donald Trump’s second term in office will unleash a more volatile period in global affairs. Some of his policy plans promise to be disruptive for an already disordered world. Among the top geopolitical developments to watch will be how the US under Trump deals with allies, adversaries and competitors. The future course of relations between theUS and Chinawill continue to be the most significant strategic dynamic in the year ahead. Given Trump’s unpredictable and mercurial personality, Sino-US relations will either see further escalation in tensions or some kind of grand bargain driven by Trump’s transactional approach.\n\nNevertheless, histhreat of imposing higher tariffson China as well as other countries with a trade surplus with the US, has prompted many experts to warn that a more intense global trade war will be among 2025’s top risks. The London-based risk consultancy firm,Control Risks, predicts that the coming year will establish “national security as the guiding principle of international trade and investment”.\nHow far Washington will go in trade protectionism advocated by Trump will be consequential for Sino-US relations, as well as for the global economy. Major trading partners especially China, are, however, already working on how to Trump-proof their strategies.The Economist, in its annual publication ‘The World Ahead in 2025’, notes that Chinese firms are already expanding abroad to get around trade barriers as well as to tap new markets in the Global South. An assessment byBlackRocksees acceleration in technology decoupling between the US and China as a high risk.\nThe year ahead will see rising geopolitical tensions, challenges to global economy and tech disruption.\n2025 will also determine how wars in Ukraine and the Middle East will play out. Trump’s statements on Ukraine suggesting a radical shift in policy seem to be making European governments nervous. Often claiming he can end the war “in a day”, Trump is expected to push Ukraine into negotiations with Russia. Although he has not offered any concrete plan to end the conflict, Trump may not be averse to a negotiated outcome that advantages Moscow, by which Ukraine has to cede territory.\nTrump has also repeatedly said he wants to end the war in the Middle East and ensure a ceasefire in Gaza. While he has avoided specifics, this will almost certainly be on Israel’s terms. He has said the US should stay out of Syria, but it is hard to see how it can do that given the complex regional ramifications of regime change there.\n\nDemocracy will continue to be under challenge across the world. The trends expected to carry over from previous years are not encouraging — continuing political polarisation in many countries, with politics becoming increasingly fractured and volatile. The erosion or even disappearance of the middle ground and weakening of the political centre seem to have become a worldwide phenomenon. This is closely associated with the rise of right-wing populism, which is continuing to sweep across much of Europe and is evident elsewhere too.\n\nDemocracy has declinedin almost all regions of the world. This global trend of democratic erosion, recorded by many international organisations, is expected to persist, with increasing ‘autocratisation’ and backsliding in democratic rights and freedoms. Global think tanks that evaluate the health of democracy in the world are all quite pessimistic about the future. Political systems in general are seen not to be delivering at a time of heightened public expectations, magnified by social media. Some global risk intelligence companies see the risks of civil unrest running high in most regions of the world.\nOne of the top risks in the year ahead identified by theGlobal Trade Review, an international trade publication, is what it calls “grey zone aggression”, that is “a threat that is difficult to define but critical to recognise”. This includes disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks and proxy wars, all of which it argues “blur the lines between traditional conflict and peacetime operations”. These newer forms of warfare are now omnipresent, challenging states to develop the capacity and imagination to deal with them. There is also the possibility of ‘black swan’ events when sudden, unexpected geopolitical developments with far-reaching consequences can transform existing power configurations and create new challenges.\nAdvances in generativeartificial intelligenceis another trend to watch in 2025. AI-powered tools in business, workplaces, entertainment, media, healthcare and personal life will become even more common. They have already brought about significant transformations in these areas. But they have also ushered in an era of tech challenges including for cybersecurity. Themilitary uses of AIpose another challenge.\n\nThe British think tankChatham Housebelieves action on global AI governance will receive greater attention in the year ahead. It points to the meeting in February of the AI Action Summit in Paris of government representatives, tech companies, scientists and experts to discuss how to evolve ‘public interest’ AI. Advanced technology, in addition to AI, has raised vexing questions of how to respond to its disruptive effects and spawning of new vulnerabilities. A digitalised world faces challenges even as it opens new opportunities in different fields including as a pathway to economic and social progress.\nThe coming year will see a world of geopolitical tensions and economic challenges that will test the resilience of nations as well as the international community’s ability to evolve collective responses to common problems."}]}

They have to be met in an unstable global environment of mounting geopolitical tensions, intense US-Chinacompetition, preoccupation of major powers with wars inUkraineand theMiddle East, and the uncertaintiesspawnedby Donald Trump’s impending second term in office. The regional landscape too is fraught and unsettled, withsecurity problemscasting a long shadow, as laid bare by recent hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Moreover, these challenges have to be tackled when the country’s economy remains fragile and dependent on external financialresourceswhile the political situation continues to be uncertain. As all foreign policy begins at home, these realities weigh heavily on the conduct of its diplomacy.\nAll challenges in the priority areas of Pakistan’s foreign policy need to be deftly handled. They include the country’s relations with China and the US, while avoiding getting into the crosshairs of their confrontation, dealing with an increasingly troubled relationship with Afghanistan, managing the adversarial relationship with India, balancing ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran and keeping relations with the EU on a positive track.\nThe big unknown is how relations with Trump’s America will shape up especially as Pakistan’s geopolitical importance has diminished for Washington since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The relationship remains at a crossroads with a reset proving elusive during President Joe Biden’s tenure. The low-level engagement of the past four years was reflected in the fact that the US secretary of state never once visited Pakistan. Nor did Biden show any interest in interacting with Pakistani leaders. In Trump’s previous term relations got off to a rocky start when he announced a halt in assistance to Pakistan including inCoalition Support Funds. For over half his tenure, there was no US ambassador in Islamabad. After Trump decided on the US exit from Afghanistan, ties warmed as Washington needed Pakistan’s help to initiate talks with the Taliban and forge agreement with them at Doha. This eventually paved the way for the American withdrawal. Beyond that — and the obvious bonhomie between Trump and former prime minister Imran Khan — the relationship remained largely devoid of bilateral content.\nPakistan has to meet challenges in an unstable global environment and fraught regional setting.\nIt is against this backdrop that Islamabad seeks re-engagement with Washington to build a relationship based on Pakistan’s intrinsic importance. The US remains Pakistan’s largest export destination, a potential source of FDI and a global power with significant influence, including over international financial institutions, whose assistance Pakistan’s crisis-prone economy constantly needs.\nA reset, however, faces several constraining factors. America’s top strategic priority is to contain China. As Pakistan cannot be part of any anti-China coalition, that limits the space for Pakistan-US relations. Another limiting factor is Washington’s growing strategic and economic relationship with India, its partner of choice in the region in its strategy to project India as a counterweight to China. Thus, the challenge is to find space for the Pak-US relationship between these two strategic realities. This will not be easy as Pakistan is unlikely to figure in Trump’s foreign policy priorities.\nChina, of course, remains Pakistan’s overriding foreign policy priority. This time-tested relationship meets both the country’s security and economic interests but is confronted with problems that need to be resolved to keep ties on a strong, positive trajectory. The most important is allying Beijing’ssecurityconcerns over Chinese personnel working in Pakistan. A spate of attacks that killed Chinese workers last year prompted China, Pakistan’s biggest investor, to publicly urge Islamabad to guarantee the safety of thousands of its workers. During the visit of a high-ranking Chinese official to Islamabad in June, Beijing’s message was publicly conveyed in a sharp manner. Liu Jianchao warned that security issues could threaten CPEC’s future and was already “shaking the confidence of Chinese investors”. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s constant requests for financing/ loan rollovers and rescheduling debt to independent power producers is overburdening relations with its closest ally. There has been no progress in talks on the latter issue. Publicly asking for debt relief has also put China in an awkward position, because of implications for its lending to other countries.\nIndia, with whom a prolonged diplomatic impasse persists, poses an imposing challenge. Relations have remained frozen and trade suspended since August 2019 when Delhi illegally annexed the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir, bifurcated and absorbed it into the Indian union. It then carried out demographic and electoral changes to consolidate control over a population whose will to resist Delhi’s rule it has nonetheless failed to diminish.\nIndia’s claim to have ‘settled’ Kashmir and refusal to talk to Pakistan on the issue presents the most formidable obstacle to normalisation of ties. The Modi government has shown no interest in resuming dialogue, apparently concluding this hurts Pakistan, not India. This is apparent from the lack of an Indian response to peace overtures from Pakistani leaders over the past year. With no movement expected in the near term the immediate task is to manage tensions with India to prevent a crisis from erupting.\nRelations with Afghanistan have plunged to another low after Pakistan recently carried out air strikes inside Afghanistan targeting hideouts of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Islamabad’s hand has been forced by Kabul’s refusal to take action against TTP that continues cross-border attacks, which intensified in 2024. While diplomatic engagement continues it has yielded nothing on this count. Although Pakistan has increasingly adopted acoerciveapproach towards Afghanistan, this has its limits as it cannot risk a breakdown in relations. This makes dealing with Kabul a difficult policy dilemma for Islamabad in 2025.\nPakistan today has troubled relations in varying degrees with all three neighbours. For decades, Pakistan’s security and foreign policy was aimed at averting a two-front scenario of hot borders with its neighbours. Today, it has ended up with unstable or insecure borders with two neighbours and unresolved border problems with a third neighbour — Iran. This situation needs to be redressed.\nPakistan’smembershipof the UN Security Council, which has just begun for a two-year term, will provide an opportunity to raise the country’s diplomatic standing on the world stage and contribute to discussions and actions on issues of international peace and security. But it is unlikely to make its foreign policy challenges any easier to deal with."}]}

That has long been a strategic compulsion given Pakistan’s troubled relations with India on its eastern flank.\nBut the assumption about securing the border with Afghanistan under Taliban rule turned out to be a strategic miscalculation. It did not take long for it to become evident that the Taliban takeover enabled the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan toreorganise, revitalise and thenescalatecross-border attacks, posing a serious security threat to Pakistan. The Taliban’s unwillingness to take action against the TTP upended Islamabad’s expectation that Kabul would be responsive to Pakistan’s security concerns.\nSuccessive reports by the UN Security Council’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team reinforced Pakistan’s assessment by the finding that the “TTP benefited the mostof all the foreign extremist groups in Afghanistan from the Taliban takeover”. Itslatest reportof July 2024 says the “TTP remained the largest terrorist group in Afghanistan, with an estimated strength of 6,000-6,500 fighters”. It “continues to operate at significant scale in Afghanistan and to conduct terrorist operations into Pakistan from there”.\n\nThe report also says “the Taliban do not conceive of TTP as a terrorist group: the bonds are close, and the debt owed to TTP significant”. According to the report, the TTP receives support — and oversight — from Afghanistan’s General Directorate of Intelligence aimed at preventing defections to IS-K, the Taliban’s principal foe. TTP’s links to Al Qaeda also continue.\nThere was a significant surge in cross-border terrorist attacks by TTP last year and rise in casualties of law-enforcement personnel, which heightened the security challenge for Pakistan. In fact, 2024 was thedeadliest yearwith the highest number of casualties in terrorist attacks in almost a decade.\nThree-and-a-half years oftalkson the TTP between Pakistani officials and Taliban authoritiesyielded little. Taliban responses ranged from asking for time to ‘manage’ TTP to urging Pakistani officials to talk to the militant group as well as offering assurances of resettling its fighters away from the border and asking for financial help to do this.\nNeither side wants a breakdown in relations, so diplomatic re-engagement is a compulsion.\nWith their patience exhausted, Pakistani authorities began to adopt a harder line towards Kabul, also undertaking unannounced kinetic attacks on TTP sanctuaries and individuals in Afghanistan. Public statements by Pakistani leaders became tougher. Taliban leaders were asked to choose between the TTP and Pakistan. Military spokesmen held the Afghan interim government squarely responsible for “arming terrorists and providing a safe haven for them”.\nLast week, Prime Minister Shehbaz SharifdemandedKabul take action to stop TTP from attacking and killing innocent people, calling that a red line for Pakistan.\n\nThis followed an audacious TTPattack on a border postin Makin in late December which left 16 security personnel dead and forced Pakistan to retaliate. Days later, on Dec 24, Pakistani fighter jetscarried out air strikesagainst TTP hideouts in Paktika province. The Taliban authorities lodged an angry protest with Islamabad and claimed their forces retaliated by hitting several Pakistani positions along the border including in Waziristan. These armed clashes injected more tensions into an already strained relationship.\nThis at a time when Pakistan’s special envoy for Afghanistan Muhammed Sadiq was in Kabulholding talkswith the Afghan Deputy Prime Minister Maulvi Abdul Kabir and other Taliban officials aimed at de-escalating tensions. Overshadowed by the air strikes, Sadiq’s visit marked an effort to reset ties with Afghanistan after over a year of coercive policy actions pursued by Islamabad.\nThese actions included, apart from unannounced air strikes (except strikes in April 2024 which were publicly acknowledged by Islamabad), transit trade restrictions and expulsion of illegal Afghan refugees from Pakistan. Kinetic actions are often referred to by Pakistani military officials as intelligence-based operations and aim to degrade TTP’s capabilities.\nCoercive actions as a whole were designed to raise the costs for the Taliban of their non-cooperation on the TTP. These measures yielded limited results. Pakistani authorities then decided diplomatic re-engagement with Kabul was necessary to prevent a breakdown in relations, resuming dialogue after a year’s hiatus to explore possibilities for resolution of trade and security disputes. Both sides seemed keen to halt the deterioration in relations with bilateral trade and transit trade having precipitously declined over the past year or so.\n\nIn fact, talks between Taliban officials and a hybrid delegation (that included military officers) led by Sadiq explored avenues to enhance economic cooperation. They ranged over key trade issues including renewal of the transit trade agreement and finalisation of a preferential trade deal as well as the one-document regime that Pakistan is implementing as part of its border control policy. These talks, according to official sources, were proceeding in a positive direction and in a “cooperative atmosphere”, with an agreement for high-level visits to resume in January, when the air strikes took place.\nAlthough the armed clashes and exchange of hot words between the two countries have put diplomatic engagement on pause, it is nonetheless expected to resume sooner rather than later. This indicates a tentative shift in Pakistan’s strategy away from a focus only on coercive actions and a one-item agenda with the Taliban involving the TTP. But there is an important caveat to this. Pakistani authorities have also signalled to Kabul that any major attack from Afghan soil will invite a Pakistani reprisal and likely hot pursuit. Casualties will not be tolerated and Pakistan’s hand will be forced to take kinetic action.\nThis carrot-and-stick policy will likely shape the planned reset of ties with Afghanistan. Islamabad hopes the combined effect of diplomatic engagement and trade inducements as well as pressure on the TTP issue would encourage Taliban authorities to respond to Pakistan’s security concerns.\nPakistan therefore seems intent on employing both incentives and disincentives in a renewed bid to prevail on the Taliban. It should also consider crafting a regional strategy in collaboration withChinaand Afghanistan’s other neighbours to mount collective pressure on Kabul to change course on the terrorism issue, which remains a common worry for the entire region."}]}

But his provocative statements earlier this month sent a different message.\nHe threatened to take over thePanama Canal and Greenland, if necessary by military force, and turnCanadainto the 51st state of the US by using “economic force”. He also suggested theGulf of Mexicoshould be renamed the “Gulf of America”. Meanwhile, his close ally and X owner Elon Musk called for theremoval of UK’s Keir Starmergovernment and declared hissupportfor the far right in Germany.\nDoes this mean Trump 2.0 is already proving to be destabilising for the world even before he starts his second term? His aggressive assertions certainly signal that, angering countries in Europe and beyond. His statements did not of course go unanswered. French and German leaders shot back to warn the US not to meddle with Europe’s borders whileDanish leaderssaid Greenland was not for sale. TheMexican presidentresponded to Trump’s remarks by saying parts of the US should instead be named Mexican America. Canada’s then prime minister,Justin Trudeau, tweeted “there was a snowball’s chance in hell” of his country becoming part of the US.\n\nBut the question is whether all this is characteristic Trumpian bluster or a disturbing indication of what’s to come, which many see as a throwback to 19th-century US imperialism or an age of territorial expansionism. TheFinancial Timesdecried Trump’s “expansionist rhetoric” as “dangerously wrong-headed” and pointed to its “unsettling” effect on America’s allies. But only time will tell whether such pronouncements will actually translate into policy actions.\nIt is hard to say if power will have a moderating effect on Trump’s conduct and policies. Although Europe seems more shaken by his utterances, it is the future course of US-China relations that will be more consequential for global stability. China has been calmly preparing to deal with Trump with its officials in touch with his team ahead of his assumption of office. Trump’s threat to imposemuch higher tariffson imports from China, and other trading partners, has raised the spectre of an escalation in the trade and tech war between the world’s two superpowers.\nBut it may not be easy to carry out that threat. The impact of such action on the American consumer will be hard to ignore as higher tariffs will fuel more inflation. China has also evolved a plan to retaliate in a tariff war by actions that could hurt American companies as well as direct its exports to other and new markets.\nWill Trump’s foreign policy be destabilising for the world as is being widely anticipated?\nGiven Trump’s transactional approach, his tariff threats may well be to generate negotiating leverage to drive a harder trade bargain with China. He has frequently said he seeks a better relationship with Beijing. He spoke by phone with President Xi Jinping before taking over and even took the unprecedented step of inviting him to his inauguration.\n\nThe Chinese leader declined but bysendingVice-President Han Zheng to attend the oath-taking he signalled readiness to positively engage with Washington. This doesn’t change the fact that a bipartisan consensus in the US views China as an adversary to be countered. America’s top strategic priority will continue to be to contain China. That doesn’t however rule out Trump seeking a grand bargain with Beijing. For his part, President Xi has said a trade war would have “no winners”. It remains an open question whether the two sides can over time agree on some kind of mutual coexistence, which would obviously be salutary for global stability.\nIn the Middle East, Trump’s intervention produced the breakthrough that resulted in aceasefire agreementin Gaza between Hamas and Israel — days before he assumed office. He wanted a quick end to the 15-month war and had said if hostages were not released before his inauguration “all hell will break out”. However, many challenges lie ahead. The Gaza deal has to be enforced in all its phases.\nTrump is expected to be unwavering in hissupport for Israelbut he is also capable of putting pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he did to seal the ceasefire deal. Members of his team are all staunchly pro-Israel. This could embolden Israel to annex the West Bank — a step Trump might approve. This would plunge the region into more turmoil. It would certainly end any possibility of an independent Palestinian state, which is the key to durable peace in the region.\n\nTrump may be more open to talks with Tehran rather than to Israel’s long-standing desire to wage war against Iran. Under a reformist president, Iran would be in favour of engaging with Washington. There are indications Trump will toughen sanctions but he may also consider this an opportune moment to negotiate with an Iran weakened by its recentsetbacks in Syriaand Israel’s pummelling of Hamas and Hezbollah. His ally Elon Musk has already met with Iran’s UN envoy in New York. Trump will in any case have to deal with a region which has seen geopolitical shifts that have realigned relations among regional states following the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia.\nClaiming he can end the Ukraine warin 24 hours, Trump has offered no specific plan on how to do this. He wants Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin to enter negotiations to forge a peace deal. But the terms on which this can happen are unclear. Trump has said a meeting with Putin will quickly be arranged.\nThe Kremlin too is keen on early engagement. European leaders’ worry is that Trump might push for an outcome that advantages Moscow and not consult them. He has in the past been critical of US financial and military support for Ukraine for a conflict he has described as a “bloody mess”.\nFor Trump unpredictability is both a habit and a tactic. Therefore, little can be said with any certainty. What seems likely though is that with such a mercurial personality in the White House committed to ‘America First’, the world is in for a turbulent phase and further weakening of multilateralism."}]}

It is their war.” This stance is baffling for someone who claimed credit for the ceasefire after 15 months of war and said “all hell will break out” if hostages were not released before his inauguration.\nAt the same time, Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff announced he would soon be travelling to the region to be part of “an inspection team” that would seek to ensure compliance with the ceasefire.\n\nMixed signals from the Trump administration on the fragile truce were further compounded by its action torevoke US sanctionson Israeli settlers in the West Bank. The sanctions were imposed by the Biden administration last year over violent settler attacks on Palestinian villagers. The executive order reversing the sanctions came at a time when settlers under the Israeli army’s protection were attacking Palestinians and setting fire to their properties.\nIsrael also escalated itsassault on the West Bankwith deadly raids on the Jenin refugee camp. According to UN officials, the camp, where 2,000 families were already forcibly displaced, had become “nearly uninhabitable” by continuing raids.\nA day after sanctions were overturned, Israel launched an ‘extensive’ military operation in the West Bank named Iron Wall, evidently emboldened by Washington’s move. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s newly appointed envoy to the UN, Elise Stefanik, told her Congressional confirmation hearing that Israel has a “biblical right” to the occupied West Bank.\n\nSome Middle East experts interpreted Israel’s aggressive actions in the West Bank as a way of distracting from the Gaza ceasefire that was fiercely opposed by far-right members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet and serve as a sop to others who saw the truce as a government failure. That view overlooks the fact that Israel’s onslaught of raids and drone strikes began before the ceasefire.\nAlso, it is not just a diversionary tactic but reflects a strategic aim — to ultimately annex the West Bank, for which Tel Aviv may now sense it could secure approval from Trump’s strongly pro-Israel administration. Several Trump picks for his administration, including Mike Huckabee, the next ambassador to Israel, have voiced support for Israel’s ‘claim’ to the West Bank.\nAnnexation of even part of the West Bank by Israel will be a deal breaker.\nIf Israel annexed the West Bank, it would rule out chances of establishing an independent Palestinian state and spell an end to the two-state solution, for which there is international consensus as also reflected in UN Security Council resolutions. Support for the two-state solution remains the formal position of the US. Trump, however, has refrained from reaffirming it while Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected it. Last week, UN Secretary General António Guterres issued a timely warning when he said at Davos that annexation would be a violation of international law.\nMeanwhile in Gaza, where displaced Palestinians have begun to return to their destroyed homes, the full scale of the devastation is now becoming evident. More bodies have been discovered under the rubble of bombed buildings. The death toll of over 47,000 in 15 months of war is rising as these bodies are found. Gaza lies in ruins with essential services in a state of collapse even as life has begun to slowly return to the Strip. Humanitarian assistance has poured in to meet urgent needs. But it will require a massive humanitarian and reconstruction effort and resources as well as permanent peace to rebuild Gaza.\n\nSo far, the ceasefire is holding, but formidable challenges lie ahead. Theceasefire agreementbetween Hamas and Israel envisages three phases. The first is to last for six weeks during which exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners is to take place, which is underway. Israeli forces have to withdraw from population centres and humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza.\nSixteen days into the first phase negotiations are to begin for the more challenging second phase. In thisprisoner exchangesare to continue, Israeli troops have to fully withdraw from Gaza and a permanent end to the war agreed. The third phase involves Gaza’sreconstruction. Fears have been voiced about the ceasefire holding through the first phase as well as the ability of the two sides to conclude and abide by a permanent truce in the second.\nUS commitment to the ceasefire agreement and its involvement in the process will be essential to ensure its full implementation. Washington after all is one the guarantors along with Qatar and Egypt. Unless there is sustained US pressure on Israel, the fate of the agreement will be uncertain. Trump’s post-inauguration remarks are not encouraging in this regard.\nAs many analysts have pointed out, he seems more interested in extending the2020 Abraham Accords— the signature Middle East initiative of his first term — which involved normalising relations between Arab states and Israel. Trump now has his sights set on bringing Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords. He told the media after his inauguration he was confident this would happen. Riyadh paused talks on this when war broke out in Gaza.\n\nIt subsequently made it clear thatnormalisationwith Israel, who Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman accused of committing genocide, will only be possible once there is a credible pathway to the creation of a Palestinian state. Whether this is reason enough for Trump to address the Palestinian issue for which he has never shown any concern remains to be seen. But there cannot be durable stability in the Middle East without an independent Palestinian state.\nFor now, peace in the Middle East hangs in the balance. Any Israeli attempt to annex even part of the West Bank will be a deal breaker. So can Israeli backtracking on the terms of the ceasefire agreement. That can even result in the resumption of war."}]}

Or that it would yield quick results. The gulf was too wide as indeed the trust deficit between the two sides. Above all, there was a big question mark about the stance of the elephant in the room on how much it was prepared to back or encourage the process. That remains crucial but indeterminate.\nThe talks which began in December broke down when the ruling coalition refused to budge on PTI’score demandsof appointing two commissions and release of its incarcerated members.\nJudicial commissions to investigate what happened in theMay 9andNov 26incidents, which PTI leaders have been accused of inciting, should not have been difficult for the government to ac­­c­e­pt to ensure talks continued for the sake of political stability.\nGovernments, after all, always have more to lose from confrontational politics and turmoil. If the government was sure of the facts, it should have acceded to the demand. What better way to substantiate its allegations against the opposition than appointing judicial commissions to ascertain facts in a neutral and legitimate way.\nTheproximate causefor PTI to call off the talks, however, was the raid on the home of the Sunni Ittehad Council leader, Hamid Raza, its close ally and spokesman of the party’s talks committee.\nBut PTI’s position that it was ready to resume negotiations if the two commissions were announced indicated it was keeping the door open for dialogue.

Nor were any jailed PTI activists released — not even a few to demonstrate an accommodative approach.\nThat PTI should have shown more patience is one thing. But for government ministers to subsequently mount the airwaves to mouth a familiar narrative against PTI vitiated the climate for talks. Prime Minister Shehbaz SharifaccusedPTI of running away from dialogue while voicing a desire for talks to continue. But he did not match his words with action.\nThe government continues to take steps towards more autocratisation of the country.\nAdding to the re-eruption of government-opposition tensions was thelatest moveby the ruling coalition to further circumscribe the freedom of expression. Having used a variety of informal methods over the past several months to control and tame the mainstream media, the government proposed changes to the cybercrime law to criminalise online speech byamendmentsto the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).\nThis has far-reaching implications for freedom of speech. Characteristically, the PML-N-led governmentrushedthe amendments through parliament without debate or consultation which were adopted amid loud protests by the opposition.\n\nUnder the amended law, whoever disseminates “fake news online” can face up to three years in jail. This is another effort to tighten government control over the digital space which has already seen a ban on X and other internet restrictions and censorship.\nThe PML-N-led coalition has gone much further than its civilian predecessors in imposing digital curbs and micromanaging the electronic media. Television channels are told what not to broadcast and even who to invite as commentators. Undeclared media curbs have involved ‘advice’ on how and who to cover in the opposition.\nThe latest Peca changes haveprovokedstrong protests — from the opposition, media and human rights organisations. PTI was joined by other parties in parliament to condemn the amendments, with an ANP leader calling it a “draconian law”.\nJournalists walked out of the National Assembly and Senate when the new law was adopted. Journalist organisations also mounted nationwide street protests that denounced Peca as a black law and an attack on free speech.\nThe Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said the law was “likely to become yet another means of targeting political workers, human rights defenders, journalists and dissidents by effectively penalising criticism of state institutions”. Newspaper editorials called it a “gag order”.\nThe government has remainedunmovedin the face of the widespread rejection of the Peca amendments. And for all the government’s posturing on keeping the “door open” for talks with the opposition it has shown little readiness to address its grievances.\nIts controversial steps including changes in Peca and earlier adoption of the26th Constitutional Amendment— which undermined the independence of the judiciary — all marked steps towards greater autocratisation of the country. They also offered little incentive to the opposition to cooperate making its stance even more rigid on talks.\nA return to confrontational politics and political turmoil will have enormous costs for the country’s economic and political stability. True that a degree of macroeconomic stability has been achieved by the government’s measures of reining in the fiscal deficit, building foreign exchange reserves and curbing inflation — after of course securing the IMF loan package. But stabilisation is fragile and requires not just for the government to stay on course but a climate of political calm.\nMoreover, a bigger economic challenge lies ahead of transitioning from stabilisation to growth and investment. This needs a stable and predictable political environment.\nRevival of political tensions will jeopardise any sustainable economic recovery and a path to growth. Economic growth was less than one per cent in the first quarter of the ongoing fiscal year. Investor confidence is obviously undermined by political uncertainty. Investment has already plummeted to a historic low. Last year, it was 13pc of GDP, the lowest in half a century.\nPolitical calm is also needed to reverse the alarming deterioration in thesecurity situationdriven by a surge in terrorist and militant violence across KP and Balochistan. This made last year the deadliest in a decade in casualties suffered by security forces.\nA cooperative relationship between the federal government and the PTI-run KP government is essential to effectively deal with the security threat from militants.\nFor these compelling reasons, both the government and opposition, especially the ruling coalition, need to rethink their positions and show flexibility to arrive at some kind of modus vivendi for the sake of the country."}]}

Additional tariffs of 25 per cent were imposed on goods from Mexico and Canada and 10pc on China. Trump justified invoking emergency powers to apply tariffs “because of the major threat of illegal aliens and drugs including fentanyl”.\nHe alsothreatenedtariffs on EU imports. He is set to announce ‘reciprocal tariffs’ on more countries in coming days. In the past, Trump often said he would act against countries that have a trade surplus with the US and tariffs will make the American economy stronger and replace income tax.\nHe has long favoured pursuing a protectionist economic agenda. Admitting tariffs would cause economic pain to the US, he nonetheless claimed it would be “worth the price that must be paid”.\n\nAmerica’s three biggest trading partners reacted quickly and furiously. Canada and Mexico hit back with retaliatory levies. China imposed counter-tariffs on a range of US products, including crude oil, LPG and farm equipment. Beijing ordered an antitrust investigation of Google and said it would file a lawsuit against the US in the World Trade Organisation.\nThe impact of Trump’s tariff move was immediate. Markets around the worldtumbledover the spectre of escalation in the global trade war. Across Asia and Europe, shares slumped while investors expressed alarm over the disruption of global supply chains and fears of volatility ahead.\nInternational investment firms anticipated a reduction in global growth and depressed business sentiment. Economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman described Trump’s action as “really destructive” and “like throwing sand in the gears of international commerce and manufacturing”.\nBut just before the tariffs on Mexico and Canada were to be enforced, Trumppausedthem for a month following phone calls with leaders of the two countries in which negotiations were agreed between them.\nBoth countries also announced they would reinforce the border to clamp down on drug smuggling and stop illicit migration.\nThis U-turn was quintessential Trump, who uses swift changes of course as a bargaining tactic to put other governments off balance in order to secure a deal. This bullying approach of pressure-and-negotiate holds up apparent concessions by other countries as ‘wins’ to his political base.\nTrumpplans to speakto President Xi Jinping to enter trade negotiations while delaying tariffs on low-value packages from China. Markets across the world reacted with relief to the pause in the tariff war, but that didn’t end uncertainty about what comes next.\nNo one expects Trump’s game of brinkmanship to end with this, and fears persist of a trade war. He repeated his familiar mantra last week that he would use tariffs to get other countries to meet his demands. Uncertainty on this count will take a heavy toll on the global economy as well as on Washington’s ties with friends and competitors alike.\nThe use of coercive economic power to browbeat smaller countries is one thing. But deploying it against a big power and the world’s largest exporter, China, is a different matter. Beijing also has the means to inflict damage on the US economy even as it grapples with the blow to its trade.\n“Bullies,” wroteThe Economistlast week, “rarely pick on any target their own size.” That is why Trump has so far desisted from levying 60pc additional tariffs on China he frequently promised during the election campaign.\nA multipolar world will not so easily bend to Washington’s will with America’s primacy eroding.\nFor its part, theEuropean Unionsaid it will respond firmly to any new tariffs and may use its anti-coercion powers if necessary. In anticipation of Trump carrying out his threat of imposing “very substantial” tariffs, the 27-member economic bloc is readying retaliatory measures against Silicon Valley.\nIn what is being described as the first use of a punitive tool against a service industry, this would mark an escalation in the trade war, although EU officials say they would rather negotiate.\nAt an informal summit in Brussels last week, European leaders declared their intention to fight back if Trump slapped higher tariffs, while calling for negotiations. Affected countries in Europe and beyond will respond to tariff rises in the longer term by finding other markets for trade.\nApart from retaliation by other countries, Trump’s tariff war will come at a price to the American economy, contrary to his disingenuous claims that they will bring the US only benefits.\n\nThe most obvious would be the impact on American consumers by way of more inflation as business costs go up. And this at a time when inflation is high, which Trump promised voters he would curb. Higher tariffs would upend supply chains, dampen growth and investment, increase the cost of borrowing and even reduce US exports.\nSeveral sectors such as the automobile industry and agriculture would be particularly hit hard. Business groups representing agriculture, automakers and those dealing with consumer products are already reported to have sounded the alarm over how tariffs will fuel price rises. The adverse economic impact on the US will be greater if Trump expands the tariff war to Europe.\nBut beyond economic implications, there will be obvious diplomatic costs for the US. Relations with countries that are bullied and pressured can hardly be expected to escape unscathed.\nEven if allies are coerced into making concessions, actions that antagonise them will leave diplomatic ties considerably damaged. The confidence of allies would be shaken in a country acting so recklessly. The global standing of the US and its credibility would be damaged, its reliability questioned and its alliances jeopardised. Adversaries hit by tariff rises will have even less of a reason to be responsive to Washington on other issues.\nTrump’s rash tariff actions,threatsto ‘own’ the Palestinian territory of Gaza, take overGreenland, and seize thePanama Canalare part of his belief that the US has the power to do whatever it likes, grab whatever it wants, and get away with it. But he will soon find the unipolar world passed into history long ago, and the multipolar world today will not so easily bend to Washington’s will."}]}

While the ruling coalition claims many achievements, this is not reflected in how the public rates its performance.\nAnIpsos opinion surveyin December found almost 80 per cent of people believed the country was going in the wrong direction. Sharif’s governance has in fact been underwhelming with several of the country’s challenges yet to be tackled and political stability still elusive.\nAdisputed general electioncast a shadow over the Sharif government from the outset of its tenure and denuded it of legitimacy. The election produced a hung parliament and fragmented mandate. Imran Khan’s PTI won aplurality of seatsto emerge as thesingle largest blocin parliament. But it was PML-N and allies backed by the establishment that formed the government, supported by the PPP.\n\nPML-N’s lack of a majority and consequent lack of self-confidence increased its dependence on the establishment, which it also needed to counter Khan and PTI. Indeed, the glue that held coalition members and the establishment together was their shared hostility to Khan.\nThis paved the way for the military to acquire the most extensive role yet in a civilian set-up. Thepost-2018 hybridgoverning arrangement transformed into one in which the military became directly involved in many more spheres of governance including the economy.\nThis was unprecedented even by the standards of Pakistan’s history of military influence over civilian governments. Sharif seemed happy to cede more space to the military leadership. This contributed to a decisive shift in the civil-military balance to the latter’s advantage.\n\nCountering PTI proved far from easy for the government. Frequent street protests by PTI and disruptions of parliamentary proceedings kept the government unsettled and preoccupied with confrontations with the opposition.May 9andNov 26saw violent street clashes with the two sides adopting sharply conflicting narratives on what happened. Political battles were also fought on the floor of the House and in the courts.\nIf the government was unable to dent Khan’s popularity by institutinglegal casesagainst him, PTI was unable to pressure the ruling coalition to free Khan,jailed since August 2023, and meet its other demands. Unable to ‘fix’ the Khan problem, the government increasingly resorted to repressive measures and crackdowns on the opposition. This pushed Pakistan in a more authoritarian direction.\nGovernance by the ruling coalition has been underwhelming and marked by growing authoritarianism.\nIncreasing autocratisation of the country under Sharif was reflected in a slew of government actions. The most consequential was the26th Constitutional Amendment. This wasrushed through parliamentand adopted without debate. It struck a blow to judicial independence by making the judiciary subservient to the executive. The amendment gave the government the power tochoose the chief justicefrom a panel of the Supreme Court’s three senior most judges.\n\nA parliamentary committee reflecting the government’s majority was empowered to nominate the CJ. Itselected Yahya Afridi, the third judge on the seniority list, as chief justice —supersedingJustice Mansoor Ali Shah, regarded astoo independent. The government also acquired the power to transfer high court judges. When it did that, judges from the Islamabad High Court objected, but in vain. The government’s manipulation of the higher judiciary sowed unprecedented division among judges and triggered protests by lawyers and the opposition.\nThe Sharif government treated parliament as a rubber stamp and also sought to stifle the freedom of expression. It went much further than its civilian predecessors in trying to control the electronic and social media. Aided by the establishment, it used informal means to ‘regulate’ the media, routinelyissuing instructionsto TV channels about its coverage.\nIt changed the cybercrime law to criminalise online speech by amending thePrevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016. Thissparked angry protestsfrom journalists but the government refused to back off. The Peca changes aimed at tightening government control over the digital space which already involved a ban on X and other internet restrictions and censorship.\n\nThe government’s economic management has meant some progress in establishing short-term macroeconomic stability. It secured a$7 billion IMF loan packageby meeting several conditionalities to impose fiscal discipline, undertaketaxandausterity measuresand limit subsidies. Its economic measures helped to stabilise the economy and control inflation but without improvements in the tax system and any structural changes in reining in expenditure.\nMoreover, stabilisation has yet to involve building sufficient capacity to repay loans. This raises doubts about its sustainability given Pakistan’s large external financing needs in coming years, low foreign exchange reserves and heavy debt burden.Exports have fallento 8pc of GDP from 16pc a decade ago. Constant requests forloan rolloversto lenders, especially China, indicate the persisting lack of repaying capacity — requiring yet more borrowing.\nThe government hasn’t been able to present an actionable home-grown economic plan that identifies past mistakes and makes a course correction to chart a sustainable path to growth. The much-toutedUraan programmedoesn’t offer a strategy that spells out how goals — such as $100bn in exports in eight years — are to be achieved. Surprisingly, it lacks emphasis on reforms.\nA transition from stabilisation to growth and investment also requires a stable political environment, which remains elusive. DespiteSIFC effortsover the past year, investment has remained stagnant. The investment-to-GDP ratio at 13pc has actually fallen from previous years.\nThe security situation deteriorated markedly under Sharif. The surge in terrorist and militant violence across KP and Balochistan made the past year thedeadliestin a decade in casualties suffered by law-enforcement personnel. The government kept convening meetings on the security challenge but was unable to show improvement on the ground.\n\nSpace does not permit an evaluation of Sharif’s foreign policy. It is sufficient to note that it has lacked any vision or strategic direction and been bereft of the clarity and coherence needed to meet challenges and respond to dramatic shifts in global geopolitics. Undertakingconstant foreign tours, especially to Gulf countries, does little to obscure this.\nSharif’s foreign policy endeavours have mostly focused on seeking loans and debt rollovers from close allies, reducing Pakistan to a supplicant in its key bilateral relationships."}]}

Elite capture of the state, the military’s long shadow over politics, poor governance, an oligarchical ruling elite’s reliance onbailoutsandborrowingto address the country’s chronic financial imbalances, little effort to tackle structural economic problems and lack of investment in human capital.\nAll of these have consequences for the country’s fate and fortunes.\nBut socioeconomic changes over the years have also been reshaping the country’s landscape. Some changes have been positive while others have created new challenges. Several developments offer an opportunity for transformation, but others and long-standing fault lines act as a constraint and barrier to change, holding the country back. Some trends are harbingers of instability. Of course, these are not the only trends in evidence but ones that appear more consequential in the present context.\nA positive trend is the rise of a larger middle class which has the potential to change the relationship between the state and citizens as members of this social group have different expectations of governance. Although Pakistani scholars differ on the size of the middle class, there is little dispute that it has grown significantly in the past two decades or more.\nStudies show it has increased fourfold since 2000 as poverty has declined. It has grown both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of the population. Its growth has also been fuelled by higher remittances from overseas Pakistanis. Expansion of the middle class has to be seen in the context of greater urbanisation. According to the2023 censusalmost 40 per cent of the population live in urban areas — a significant increase from the previous 2017 census. Research shows the size of the middle class has tripled in urban areas and in Punjab and Sindh.\n\nThe urban middle class is a potentially influential economic and social group that is now politically engaged and wants a bigger voice in national affairs. While not homogenous, it includes educated, professional, salaried people as well as middle-income employees in state and private business enterprises.\nMembers of the middle class are becoming more assertive in voicing their aspirations for competent governance based on meritocracy and a political system that serves the public good and is not driven by patronage. To be an agent for change, they need, however, to act in an organised way and a political vehicle to mobilise them.\nOnly a visionary and reformist leadership can seize opportunities and deliver competent governance.\nDigital technology has also transformed the national landscape and people’s lives. Information and communication technology has created a more ‘connected’ society and made citizens better informed and more aware of their rights. Smartphone users are at an all-time high. The number ofinternet usersis now over 110 million with around 71m social media users.\n\nMost people today have access to greater information and are more engaged with national affairs. This is changing how people assess governments and what they want from them. Digital technology has also emerged as an effective vehicle for political mobilisation and expression of dissent. It is this that has prompted the authorities to crack down on digital space by newregulations or lawsand imposeinternet curbs.\nLike elsewhere, in Pakistan too digital technology can act as a force multiplier and power positive developments — empowering people, advancing knowledge and transforming society in many ways. It has fuelled social and economic progress across the world and can play a similar role in Pakistan’s future development trajectory. A2024 UNDP reportdepicted digital technology as a transformative and democratising force for Pakistan, “capable of bridging the gap between existing human development deficits and a future of prosperity and growth”.\nThat brings up the human development deficit in education. This is a persisting negative trend that is a huge constraint on the country’s economic progress and chances of political transformation. No issue is more consequential for Pakistan’s future than the coverage and quality of education. Yet underinvestment in education has meant 40pc of Pakistanis are still illiterate while 26m school-age children areout of school— the world’s second highest number. Among those who go to school, learning poverty remains high. Pakistan obviously cannot achieve economic growth and progress by failing to invest in its people.\n\nGiven Pakistan’s youthful demographic profile the education deficit has even more troubling implications. Over two-thirds of the population are below the age of 30. That means the young will determine the country’s future trajectory. But if they are not educated and employment is not available to them, they face a hopeless and jobless future, which will blight the country’s prospects.\nTo reap the demographic dividend, Pakistan has to educate the young and equip them with skills. The youth bulge offers a huge opportunity for accelerated economic growth if the country makes the needed investment in human capital. If it fails to do so, then a demographic disaster awaits with obvious implications for social stability.\nThese challenges have remained unaddressed because the narrow power elite that dominates and controls the country’s political system is more interested in serving its own interests and perpetuating the status quo than promoting the public welfare. This has been the biggest barrier to change.\nThe power elite, constituted by both political and military elites, has resisted meaningful reform and focused on short-term goals for its political survival and to preserve its ascendancy. Politics and governance in this elite-dominated system is more about leveraging the spoils system and using patronage to reward supporters than framing public policies.\n\nPolitical contests are rarely about issues, but reflect a tussle for power betweendynastic political partiesand other political groups that are extensions of personalities. None of this can deliver competent governance.\nHow in the face of these impediments can the positive developments mentioned above be harnessed to steer the country towards a better future? By a leadership that believes in change and reform and is committed to transforming the country’s governance into one aimed at promoting the public welfare rather than protecting the privileges of the elite.\nOnly a visionary leadership willing to take risks and unafraid of opposition from entrenched elites can seize opportunities and surmount hurdles to make Pakistan into a country its people want and deserve."}]}

It has sent countries scrambling to find ways to navigate the new global terrain and figure out how to engage with Washington under Trump’s mercurial management. He has upended US foreign policy on several fronts including theMiddle EastandUkraine, jettisoned Western allies, all but abandoned the transatlantic alliance, and deliver­­ed more blows to multilateralism. His imposition oftariffson friends and competitors alike has rai­sed the spectre of a global trade war. Trump’s ‘Am­­erica First’ unilateralist approach is further fragmenting the global order and ushering in a disruptive and volatile phase in international affairs.\nThis is the context in which Islamabad is weighing where it will figure with Trump’s America. Both the government andoppositionhave been trying, so far unsuccessfully, to elicit the new ad­­minis­tr­ation’s attention. In fact, relations between the US and Pakistan have been at aninflection poi­­ntsince the American withdrawal from Afg­h­anistan in 2021. For over two decades, the war in Afgha­n­istan provided the principal basis for engagement between the US and Pakistan even as it became a source of mutual mistrust and disenchantment.\n\nAfter that ended, Pakistan’s diminished geopolitical importance for Washington drove relations to a low point. On the other hand, Pakistan’s long-standing strategic ties with China continued to intensify. Increasingly, America was seen as a self-absorbed and inconsistent partner as well as a reluctant regional player. China was perceived as having the will, money and growing global clout needed for a more constructive and enduring relationship that met both Pakistan’s defence and economic interests.\nBenign disengagement between Pakistan and the US may be the best option for now.\nNevertheless, Pakistan sought a reset in ties with the US. But this proved elusive. President Joe Biden’s tenure saw little high-level engagement and he showed no interest in interacting with Pakistan’s leaders. The low point in relations was also reflected in the fact that the US secretary of state never once visited Pakistan during the Biden years. Military-to-military contacts, however, continued as did CT cooperation. The Biden administration’s parting shot was to impose sanctions on several Pakistani entities aiding its missile programme. Although this had little impact, the tough statement accompanying the move, promptly denounced by Islamabad, did sour ties.\nIn Trump’s first term, relations got off to a turbulent start when he accused Pakistan of “lies and deceit”, claiming it was not helpful in Afghanistan despite receiving “billions of dollars” in US aid. He went on to suspend security assistance including coalition support funds. But re-engagement got underway when Trump decided on exiting Afghanistan and sought Pakistan’s help for talks with the Taliban to strike a deal at Doha. Apart from that and the evident geniality between Trump and former prime minister Imran Khan, the bilateral relationship remained undefined and shorn of substance.\nThis posed the challenge then as it does today of resetting ties in a fundamentally changed global and regional environment. The history of the roller coaster relationship, with cyclical swings between intense engagement and deep estrangement, shows that positive transformations in ties were always driven by geopolitical storms or superpower dynamics extraneous to the bilateral relationship. America’s shifting geopolitical concerns that shaped its regional priorities also defined relations with Pakistan. They drove bilateral ties into different phases with security issues determining the relationship.\nIn the Cold War, when the US aim was to contain communism, Pakistan became America’s ‘most allied ally’. Then after 1979 there was a mutual interest to roll back the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. The third, post-9/11 phase involved defeating Al Qaeda in the ‘war on terror’. This ended with the US pullout from Afghanistan.\nDespite their close cooperation in these three phases, there was always an elephant in the room. In the first, it was India. The US priority was to defeat communism, but for Pakistan ties with Washington were part of its external balancing strategy of seeking extra-regional support to address its security dilemma given the vast power asymmetry with a hostile India. In the second phase, the elephant in the room was Pakistan’s nuclear programme even as the two collaborated in the joint struggle against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. This divergence was to surface after the Russian defeat when the US imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Islamabad on the nuclear issue and Pakistan became America’s most sanctioned friend.\n\nIn the most recent phase, Pakistan’s communication channels with the Taliban produced a disconnect with the US. Islamabad believed that one day everyone would have to deal with them but Washington saw this as evidence of Pakistan’s ‘double game’.\nIt is against this backdrop that Islamabad seeks to reconfigure ties with the US based on Pakistan’s intrinsic importance and not as a sub-set of Ame­rica’s other concerns. But a reset faces many challenges.\nFor a start, Pakistan does not figure in the Trump administration’s recast priorities. There are other constraining factors. America’s top strategic priority is to contain China. Although Pakis­tan says it wants to balance relations between the US and China, it sees its strategic future to lie with China and will not be part of any anti-China coalition. This limits the space for Pakistan-US relations. So does America’s growing strategic and economic relationship with India, its partner of choice in the region in its strategy to project India as a counterweight to China. Finding space betw­een these two strategic realities is a challenge for the Pakistan-US relationship. Another limiting factor is Pakistan’s economic weakness which acts as a major impediment for meaningful relations.\nImportant as future relations with the US are, perhaps until Pakistan is able to empower itself economically and fix its domestic problems a phase of benign disengagement between the two countries is preferable. Keeping its head down — for now — with an administration that only wants to play by its own rules and whose proclivity for capricious conduct can create unnecessary problems is an option worth considering by Pakistan. This is not an argument to put diplomacy on hold but to consider whether over-eagerness for engagement with a preoccupied and transactional Wash­ington without having much to offer or gain is in Pakistan’s interest. Showing strategic patience and waiting it out may serve the country better."}]}

The world is more interconnected than ever before but also atomised. This has been accentuated by the ever-growing but complex and crowded media landscape. In the information age, trivia and falsehood compete with information to engage our attention, challenging us to separate the two and focus on what is factual and really important. Moreover, profusion of information does not necessarily mean an accretion in knowledge.\nThere is now a growing body of literature that deals with information and communication technology. Some books extol its benefits and virtues while others express scepticism and point to its dangers and detrimental consequences. A compelling new publication, Superbloom: How Technologies of Connection Tear Us Apart by Nicholas Carr, belongs firmly to the latter category. Carr has written several books on the impact of technology on people’s lives and thinking. His previous work, The Shallows,analysed what the internet was doing to our brains, in which he argued it was seriously affecting our ability to think deeply even as it was opening new vistas for us. His new book takes that conversation forward and expands on it by examining how digital communication technology — information systems, online platforms and tools that include smartphones, the internet, computers, social media and artificial intelligence — are influencing and changing the lives of people and societies.\n\nAll these connections that enable people to receive so much information and messages at unprecedented speed and scope should broaden minds, enlarge empathy and create more understanding and harmony. It is often assumed that by making communication more efficient and accessible a lot of problems can be fixed.\nBut, Carr argues, it hasn’t turned out this way. In fact, it has unleashed unforeseen and unintended consequences, which have had a contrary effect, undermining understanding and trust and contributing to strife and social disharmony. Speed and intensity in the flow of information and stimuli force people to rely on intuitive thinking based on biases. It robs them of the ability to tap into deeper analysis. It has undermined careful reading, reasoned analysis, methodical evaluation and contemplative inquiry. “Attention splinters, understanding grows thin,” he posits, adding “rather than levelling barriers to knowledge, it becomes a barrier itself”. This results in mental shortcuts and shallow thinking.\nCarr takes readers on a fascinating journey through the history of technological advancement, starting with the invention of the telegraph to present-day large-scale communication networks along with the profits made by giant, unaccountable tech companies. He draws on psychology and sociology to buttress many of his observations. Every advance in media, he writes, was accompanied by “millenarian rhetoric”. Each time, claims were made about how the world would become a better, friendlier place with people joined in happy brotherhood. Personal diplomacy would be rendered obsolete, crises averted and wars prevented. None of this, of course, happened. Therefore, Carr asserts, “we had been telling ourselves lies about communication and about ourselves”.\nCommunication technology has brought untold benefits but also involved harmful repercussions.\nHe reserves his most scathing critique for social media and the tech companies that run them. The consequences of this have yet to be fully fathomed. More than promoting facts and truth, social media amplifies falsehoods and hostility. Shorn of communication barriers, it brings people’s worst instincts into play. The “ugly content that pervades the social media” he also attributes to tech companies and the role played by algorithms. They choose content to stir strong emotions that create a slippery slope compelling people to be drawn even more into the ‘feed’. “Social media churns out information that’s been highly processed to stimulate not just engagement but also dependency.” Moreover, in encouraging excessive and unchecked self-exposure before a mass-media-sized audience, it tears down all boundaries. This leads to discord, not harmony.\nYes, he says, close bonds can be formed online, but that and other benefits don’t outweigh the drawbacks, including psychological harm. Carr questions the narrative that digital media is a democratising vehicle, which to him overlooks how it breeds extreme views, polarisation and fanaticism. He argues it is more conducive to authoritarian movements and cults of personality. Communication media, he claims, is anything but politically neutral. It spawns asymmetries of power as it determines what we know and therefore shapes our thinking in the process.\nSome of Carr’s assessments about digital technology bring to mind a very readable and insightful book published much earlier. This saw it producing another kind of outcome — loneliness, both personal and political. The Lonely Planet, by British economist Noreena Hertz, had a different focus, as the title of her book indicates, but it also considered the damaging effects of communication technology and social media. Of course, what she described as a global pandemic of loneliness — defined as a feeling of being unsupported in a social and familial context and also by fellow citizens, governments and the state — was ascribed to a conflation of diverse factors and events. They included “structural and institutional discrimination”, an urbanisation wave, rise of neoliberalism and fundamental changes to how we live.\nBut Hertz also assigned an “integral role” to social media and smartphones in making people “more angry and tribal”. In analysing ‘digital distraction’, she used research findings to press the case that technology and social media are also contributing to the loneliness crisis. Smartphones “fragment our attention”, estrange us from people and “create a splintered self” — among other damaging effects she mentions. Apart from pushing people into isolated digital bubbles, social media is creating a meaner, more aggressive world. This is more than apparent from trolling and offensive online behaviour. Therefore, Hertz urges the need to hold social media to account and acknowledge the dangers of “tech addiction”.\nNone of this, however, means that the enormous opportunities communication and digital technology offer and their untold benefits should be discounted. They are wide-ranging and have powered many promising developments and helped to fuel unprecedented social and economic progress. But these books offer instructive insights into the vulnerabilities and harmful repercussions they create which have yet to be mitigated or effectively managed."}]}

His imposition of tariffs against allies and competitors risks a full-blowntrade warthat will prove immensely damaging for the global economy and also consequential for the US.\nTrump assumes he can use US power — theEconomistcalls it the Don Corleone approach — to browbeat other countries into doing his bidding and at no cost to America. But the growing pushback from countries, big and small, shows how mistaken this assumption is. It is becoming increasingly evident that nations faced with Trump’s actions are determined to stand up to US pressure.\nTake for example Beijing’s response to Trump’s imposition of two rounds of tariffs on Chinese goods.China retaliatedby imposing tariffs on a range of US products including agricultural goods that are likely to hurt American farmers hard. As trade tensions mounted, a spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in Washington said: “If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.”\nIn fact, measured statements from Chinese officials earlier have given way to tougher rhetoric aimed at sending a strong message to both the US administration and the public in their own country that China will not take Trump’s actions lying down. The strongest statement so far came from China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi during a press conference in Beijing earlier this month. He accused the US of using “two-faced methods” to engage and suppress China to the detriment of bilateral relations.\nThese efforts, he said, would fail as will any attempt to drive a wedge between China and Russia, which some have read into Trump’s overtures to President Vladimir Putin. The China-Russia relationship, Wang said, “is a constant in a turbulent world, not a variable in geopolitical games”. By both their rhetoric and actions, Chinese leaders have signalled resolve to counter Trump’s moves.\nThe pushback from other countries is taking different forms but indicates that Trump won’t find it easy to secure compliance with his plans. His outrageous idea of the US taking over Gaza, forcibly relocating Palestinians from their homeland and turning it into a ‘Riviera of the Middle East’ was universally condemned andrejected, especially by Muslim and Arab states but also many of America’s European allies.\n\nOpposition from even Washington’s closest Arab friends prompted Trump to backtrack, claiming his plan was a “recommendation” not an “enforcement”, but still the “best approach”. More recently, he said “no one is expelling Palestinians from Gaza”.\nArab states came up with an alternative in the shape of the Egyptian plan for Gaza’s rebuilding and governance. This has been endorsed by the 57-member OIC, backed by Hamas and supported by France, UK, Germany and Italy. This foils the Trump proposal and has not surprisingly been rejected by the US and Israel. There are many hurdles to cross before it can be implemented but for now it serves as a rebuke to Trump’s designs.\nAs in the past, the US under Trump is underestimating the power of nationalism across the world.\nThe response of countries to Trump’s pressure tactics has been a function of how dependent they are on the US and varied — offering talks to resolve problems, defiance and retaliatory measures as well as adopting hedging strategies. Trump has shown marked animosity towards neighbouring Canada, slapping stiff tariffs on its goods, repeatedly proclaiming the country should become the 51st state of America and that he will use economic coercion to achieve it.\n\nThis has provoked a furious response from Canadian leaders, with Ottawa hitting back with counter tariffs. It responded to US tariffs on metals byannouncing levieson around $30 billion worth of US imports. The Trump effect in Canada also saw a surge in the Liberal party’s popularity with its new leader and prime minister, Mark Carney, promising to confront the US, saying, “We didn’t ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves”.\nMeanwhile, Mexico, with an economy acutely vulnerable to the impact of sweeping tariffs on its goods, also signalled resistance to Trumpian pressure. Rejecting any capitulation to US demands and “interventionism”, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum declared: “Coordination, yes; subordination, no.” Greenland’s likely new prime minister vehemently rejected Trump’s desire to annex the island saying “We don’t want to be Americans”.\nEuropean nations, stunned by Trump’s reversal of policy on the Ukraine war, his reaching out to Putin,public spatwith President Volodymyr Zelensky and being shut out of US talks with Russia, have quicklycome togetherto evolve a unified position. Confronting a transatlantic rift but trying not to offend Trump, they made their views known by showing solidarity with Zelensky “in the face of Russian aggression” and insisting on security guarantees in any negotiated end to the war.\nThey have sought ways to bolster Ukraine’s military capabilities and Europe’s defences and offer Washington a peace plan that doesn’t involve Ukrainian surrender to Russia. This pushback has involved a delicate balancing act but marks Europe’s effort not to be marginalised by the US in its endgame strategy on Ukraine.\n\nFaced with an unreliable America, French President Emmanuel Macron’s call for “strategic autonomy” is getting wider traction in Europe. Meanwhile, theEU retaliatedsharply to US tariffs on aluminium and steel imports by significantly increasing levies on American products.\nTrump may be extreme in his imperious, unilateralist ways but there is continuity with past US conduct in an important respect. Throughout its history of dealing with other nations, the US has underestimated the power of nationalism and the resistance it would meet in trying to force its will on others.\nThis has been responsible for its military debacles, diplomatic setbacks and strategic failures as exemplified by its experience from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Ironic that a country that is so jingoistic itself is unable to understand nationalist sentiment in other nations."}]}

The first concerns the terrorist attack and hijacking of theJaffar Express trainin Balochistan and statements that followed from Pakistani officials. The second development involves Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’sallegationsin a podcast that Pakistan is waging a proxy war against his country. This war of words is, of course, nothing new but its re-eruption makes it even harder to overcome the protracted diplomatic impasse between the two countries.\nFollowing the terrorist incident in Balochistan, Pakistan’s military spokesman accused India of complicity, saying the country’s eastern neighbour has long been involved in fomenting such violence and supporting militant groups. These accusations echo what Islamabad has consistently said about Indian interference; the arrest of RAW operativeKulbhushan Jadhavin 2016 being incontrovertible evidence of this. The Indian naval officer who was convicted of espionage had confessed to his role in subversive activities in Pakistan and assisting Baloch militant groups. India predictably rejected the latest allegations by Pakistani officials as “baseless” saying Pakistan should instead “look inwards”.\nIn a podcast with Lex Fridman, broadcast on March 16, Prime Minister Modi’s lengthy remarks about the tense relationship with Pakistan added to the toxic environment between the two countries. He attributed the troubled bilateral relationship to Pakistan’s pursuit of “state-sponsored terrorism” and insincere peace efforts over decades. Claiming India had made peace moves but they were met by “betrayal” by Pakistan, which had not chosen the path of peaceful coexistence, he described Pakistan as the “epicentre of turmoil.” This was familiar rhetoric but its strident reiteration at this juncture injected more strains into the relationship.\nThe outlook for any India-Pakistan normalisation remains bleak.\nModi’s comments, in fact, reinforce the narrative India has increasingly built against Islamabad. This places the blame entirely on Pakistan for the slide in relations as well as shifts the onus on it for any resumption of ‘normal’ diplomatic relations. It is also part of a strategy to mount pressure on Pakistan in what is seen by many in India as a moment of vulnerability. This is also indicated by the way the Indian media went into overdrive after the Balochistan terror attack in what seemed an orchestrated and hyper coverage of the incident.\n\nAll this leaves relations between the two neighbours in an uncertain and unstable place. In the absence of formal dialogue, suspended now for well over five years, and given the nature of issues driving present tensions, a backchannel may be useful to manage tensions and avert the risk of miscalculation by either side.\nIslamabad seems interested in putting such a mechanism in place and has conveyed this informally through the track two process, which involves exchanges between former officials and other participants from the two countries. In a track two interaction held in London in late February, the Indian side did not respond to Pakistan’s backchannel suggestion. Instead, it said this could be discussed at the leadership level either on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in July or UNGA in September. That, of course, is if the two prime ministers meet.\nAt the official level, the Indian view is that existing arrangements are adequate to manage or prevent any crisis and a formal backchannel is not required for now. The reference seems to be to communication that has taken place on an ad hoc basis between Rawalpindi and India’s national security adviser when tensions escalated in the past. The last time this happened was during theBrahmos incidentin March 2022, when India accidentally fired a missile from Ambala that landed in Mian Channu in Pakistan. The dangerous situation was quickly defused and a crisis averted.\nThere are several obstacles to the resumption of formal talks between the nuclear neighbours. The biggest hurdle is the seemingly unbridgeable gap in the two countries’ positions on occupied Jammu and Kashmir. Relations, in fact, broke down when India illegally annexed, bifurcated and absorbed the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir into the Indian union onAug 5, 2019— in violation and defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. Delhi’s action, accompanied by a sweeping set of repressive measures, prompted Pakistan to suspend trade and downgrade diplomatic ties by recalling its high commissioner. The Modi government’s post-2019 actions in J&K further intensified tensions with Pakistan.\nIndia wants Pakistan’s acceptance of Aug 5, 2019, to be the starting point for any re-engagement and is not willing to show any flexibility much less offer any concessions. Its officials have repeatedly said the Kashmir ‘problem’ has been ‘resolved’ and there is nothing to negotiate with Pakistan. In August 2024, Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar declared the “era of uninterrupted dialogue with Pakistan is over … So far as J&K is concerned, [abrogation of] Article 370 is done”. This take-it-or-leave-it approach puts Pakistan in a dilemma. However much the current Pakistani leadership may want to move towards a modus vivendi with India, it cannot abandon its principled position on Kashmir. Relegating Kashmir to the backburner to resume other aspects of the relationship such as trade will enable Delhi to construe that as Pakistan’s de facto acceptance of its August 2019 action. How to square this circle remains a vexing policy challenge.\nNevertheless, working level engagement on practical issues continues through diplomatic missions in both capitals. This led in October 2024 to renewal of the agreement onKartarpur Corridorfor another five years to enable Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit the holy site. This was done at New Delhi’s request. Issuance of visas by both sides for visits to religious sites has been another area of cooperation as has release of fishermen who stray into each other’s territorial waters.\nThis low-level diplomatic channel obviously can’t produce a thaw. The relationship can only be extricated from its frozen state by the leadership on both sides who show the will and accommodation needed to bring this about. But for now, the Indian leadership seems to have concluded that disengagement with Pakistan better serves its interests. The BJP government also sees a political advantage in constantly demonising Pakistan as this reinforces its Hindutva agenda."}]}

But failure to do so by successive foreign secretaries has taken a heavy institutional toll. An unnecessarily timid and submissive attitude towards other stakeholders has defined the conduct of recent holders of this office with few exceptions.\nPakistan’s foreign ministry needs reform to make it fit for purpose.\nThis is a sorry departure from the past. In the 1990s and 2000s, foreign secretaries did not shy away from standing up to a military ruler and giving policy recommendations to prime ministers even when that did not accord with their views. The foreign secretary’s fundamental responsibility is to fearlessly offer sound advice, resist flawed or whimsical decisions taken elsewhere and defend policy determination by MoFA. The foreign secretary must ensure promotions and postings are made on merit, not favouritism or political considerations. His/her job is also to foster a culture of open in-house discussion, not discourage independent, out-of-the-box thinking.\nThe structural deficiencies in the foreign ministry’s working methods, organisation and training of personnel need to be urgently fixed. The ministry still operates in silos and remains reactive rather than proactive. To make the ministry more relevant and help it regain lost ground the quality of its policy inputs has to be improved. That will make it harder for other stakeholders to ignore its views and just dictate to it. Clear objectives and priorities should be set at the beginning of the year with regular review and reassessment undertaken throughout the year. The policy planning division needs to be revitalised and placed at the core of the ministry’s strategic functioning.\nA complete overhaul of working methods should be undertaken to improve communication within headquarters, between divisions that often operate in silos, and with missions. The information flow is either too slow or absent, seriously handicapping mission work. Ambassadors can only be effective if they are kept regularly briefed. Sharing of timely information is impeded by a communication and feedback system that needs urgent modernisation, without compromising security. It also needs a change in mindset from one that prizes monopolising information over sharing it. Of course, the ministry itself has to have access to information and be kept on board when policy decisions are taken elsewhere.\nMajor reform is also needed in several areas of training. The generalised initial training has to be replaced by more specialised training in which practical aspects of diplomacy should be taught along with knowledge of foreign policy. In other words, training modules should be focused on how to negotiate and communicate as well as teach skills for public diplomacy, especially to deal with a complex media landscape — modern tools every diplomat needs. This is important in a world in which multiple non-state actors shape a country’s foreign policy outlook. Certainly, use of social media should be in the diplomat’s toolkit, but as of now, the foreign ministry has yet to evolve any rules for its use. Diverse expertise is required on a complex array of global issues. Training should cater to these rather than be stuck in mental maps of the past.\nForeign policy cannot be conducted on the cheap. This is why an adequately resourced ministry having financial autonomy is crucial to the performance of its core functions. Pakistan’s foreign ministry/ missions are among the world’s most under-resourced. The ministry must have the means to adapt quickly to changing needs. For that, it needs greater financial authority within an enlarged budget. The numerical strength of the service also needs to expand, especially as the volume of work and complexity of international issues have increased and so have avenues for diplomatic outreach. The financial burden on the exchequer can be offset by cutting down the support staff of a tail-heavy service.\nThese decisions are obviously for the government to take. But the foreign ministry can help itself by urging the prime minister to set up a task force to propose reforms. Until then, it should try to regain its influence by offering quality analysis and policy advice that can also persuade the military establishment to treat the ministry as the country’s first line of defence."}]}

A hard state is not necessarily a strong or competent one. Perhaps it is preferable to use the notion of a competent or strong state instead of a ‘hard state’.\nA competent state would mean one that is able to effectively perform the core functions of a strong state — collect taxes to run the state, ensure rule of law, maintain order, control the borders and deliver public goods. It is also one in which the instruments of governance are robust and institutions fit for purpose. Trust is another essential attribute. A well-functioning, trusted state is what constitutes a competent state. Judged against these criteria, Pakistan has a long way to go before it can be considered a strong and competent state. That is a goal to aim for, if not an imperative for the country.\nAlso relevant to this discussion is the recognition that power and authority are not the same thing. People often deem power and authority to be synonymous. But power, however ‘hard’, does not necessarily confer authority.\n\nAuthority is where power,legitimacyand public purpose intersect. Authority rests on the legitimate exercise of power in the public interest that goes beyond the narrow interests or self-preservation of the ruling elite. The ‘rightful’ use of power, deployed to promote a public agenda, bestows authority. Authority is thus more a relationship (with the governed) than a capacity. It is based on consent, willingly given, as well as trust, not coercion. Authority also depends critically on credibility.\nIf one applies these concepts to the present state of play in the country, it becomes more than apparent how the state and those running it come up short. As theongoing debateabout ‘hardening the state’ has been generated by the grim situation in Balochistan, it needs to be considered at length.\nThe state’s managers have mostly used kinetic means to establish peace in a province that has long been characterised by historical grievances, popular discontent, poor governance and a sense of injustice with both the kind of unrepresentative rule thrust upon it and the iniquitous allocation of resources. Today, it is in turmoil and in the midst of a raging insurgency that the state’s managers are struggling to contain and defeat.\nCoercive actions do not ‘harden’ the state but harden public opinion against the power elite.\nThere is little doubt there isforeign involvementin fomenting terrorist violence and supporting militant groups in Balochistan. But it is the fertile ground created by flawed policies over the decades that has enabled hostile powers to exploit the situation. Certainly, this aspect of the security threat has to be tackled, but it means creating the internal conditions to deter and prevent external interference.\nThe state has not lacked hard power resources and instruments to use against militant violence in Balochistan. They have been deployed over the years in the form of repeated military operations and crackdowns. But on their own and in the absence of meaningful non-kinetic efforts — political, economic, social — to address the underlying drivers of public disaffection, they have ended up unintendedly exacerbating the situation.\nIt iscounter-insurgency101 that insurgents have to be isolated and the trust and support of the local community won. But in conflating militants with Baloch nationalists and casting every dissident group and political leader as traitors or abettors of terrorists, the state’s policy contradicts the basic principle of how to fight militancy, which is not to increase the number of adversaries.\n\nEngaging with thegrievancesthat militants exploit is essential for any effective counter-insurgency strategy. But, instead of doing this, therecent crackdownon the Baloch Yakjehti Committee andarrestsof its leaders and human rights activists have only compounded the explosive situation. It risks further radicalising opinion in the province.\nForciblypreventing a protest marchto Quetta led by former chief minister and leader of the Balochistan National Party, Akhtar Mengal, to press for release of detainees, made matters even worse. The Jamhoori Watan Party also accused Balochistan’s authorities of using force to block its protest. Leaders of several political parties gathered in Quetta tocondemn government curbson protest rallies and sit-ins. All this is putting the federation under greater strain.\nThe use of coercive power in a political vacuum with unrepresentative provincial governments in place — including the present one — has meant state actions have lacked the authority and legitimacy needed to elicit public support. Legitimacy is built by meeting people’s needs and aspirations. Long festering, unfulfilled demands of Baloch groups and citizens — as, for example, onmissing persons— have deepened the sense of public alienation. This has built an environment in which the use of hard power has proven to be counterproductive.\nThis is not to say law-enforcement actions are not needed to counter militant violence. Of course they are. They are necessary but not sufficient to deal with the multiple dimensions of the complex situation in Balochistan. They have to be undertaken with the consent of the local population, whose grievances have to be addressed. Without building trust, observing human rights and winning hearts and minds, no number of coercive actions by a ‘hardened state’ will succeed in defea­ting militants and establish peace and stability.\n\nIf a comprehensive national security strategy requires mobilisation of all elements of national power, why does state policy not involve that in Balochistan? To see the situation there only through a law-and-order prism is to denude counter-militancy strategy of the necessary political, economic, social and strategic communication dimensions. Without a strong political dimension in the state’s response, that meets the requirements of legitimacy, peace and security will remain elusive.\nElsewhere, across the country, the panoply of hard power and coercion being used against the political opposition and in curbing the media and muzzling dissent is strengthening neither the government nor the state. Far from ‘hardening’ the state, it is hardening public sentiment against the power elite and further eroding trust in state institutions. A strong state is built by empowering citizens, not repressing them."}]}

It left countries scrambling to respond by either imposing counter levies or seeking negotiations to secure lower rates. The US stock market lost $5.4 trillion within two days of the announcement while global stock markets lost $5tr as fears intensified about a global recession. The prospect of a full-blown trade war shook investor confidence. The IMF warned this would significantly affect already sluggish global economic growth. The head of America’s central bank warned increased tariffs would lead to “higher inflation and slower growth”.\nUsing emergency powers, Trump slapped so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on America’s trading partners that ranged from baseline 10 per cent to 50pc, an action that did not discriminate between friend and foe. The steepest tariffs were imposed on Asian countries withChinainitially facing 34pc (added to previous levies and an additional 50pc it took the net rate later to 104pc). EU was subjected to a blanket 20pc levy. Trump’s justification rested on flimsy grounds — that this will boost the US economy by reducing its trade deficit, bring manufacturing and jobs home, promote investment in the country, raise revenue to finance deep domestic tax cuts, and protect American businesses and workers. Most of these assumptions are deeply flawed but the Trump administration rejected the view that the measures would hurt US industries and lead to recession and higher prices for American consumers.\n\nTheFinancial Timesdescribed Trump’s decision as “one of the greatest acts of self-harm in American economic history”. In similar vein,The Economistwrote in its leader that Trump’s announcement, which marked the biggest break in America’s trade policy in over a century, “committed the most profound, harmful and unnecessary economic error in the modern era”. It dubbed Trump’s economic ideas as delusionary “nonsense”. Former US treasury secretary Janet Yellen described the tariffs as “the worst self-inflicted wound” she had ever seen imposed on a well-functioning economy.\nThe world’s response was swift and strong. America’s biggest trading partner and the world’s largest exporter, Chinaretaliatedby announcing a matching 34pc tax on US imports. When Trump imposed additional duties, Beijing also raised tariffs and said it would “fight till the end”. This marked a dangerous escalation in the trade war and drove the two global powers towards a historic split. European leaders roundly denounced Trump’s tariffs as “illogical” and “paranoid”.\nTrump’s tariff policy has sparked a trade war and damaged US credibility.\nWith markets tanking, American bankers and businessmen panicking and heavy sell-off in US bonds, Trump suddenly switched course. He backed down against a range of countries he claimed wanted negotiations and did not take retaliatory actions.\nHe announced a 90-daypauseon tariffs but added more levies on China taking them eventually to 145pc. The policy U turn — so characteristic of Trump — was apparently the result of combined pressure from the US business community, foreign governments and Congressional leaders including Republicans. But while it temporarily halts higher duties on many countries, it doesn’t end uncertainty about Trump’s next protectionist moves. A 10pc levy on most countries is still in force while some assessments show that despite Trump’s retreat “tariffs average over 25pc across all trading partners, when weighted by America’s imports last year”.\nHow far Trump’s tariffs are a negotiating tactic to force trading partners to align with Washington’s interests will soon be tested. His 90-day pause suggests negotiations may enable some countries to bargain for lower rates in return for concessions. What those concessions are will be determined by Trump. But while Trump’s climbdown has come as a relief to many countries, no one can be sure he won’t flip again. In any case, the damage to US credibility has been incalculable. Markets remain jittery while Trump’s erratic policies have injected volatility into the global economy. The US-China trade clash — with China hiking retaliatory tariffs to 124pc — will dampen global growth and raise inflation in America.\nThe geopolitical consequences could be even greater as nations across the world begin to recalculate their relationship with an unpredictable, whimsical, bullying power whose reliability is in growing doubt. Trump’s economic warfare made no distinction between friend and adversary; almost everyone being deemed “cheaters”. It angered nations across the world, placing traditional relations with allies under strain and ratcheting up tensions with them. This may affect cooperation by them on other fronts too. It could set in train a realignment of relations and even reshape geopolitics over time.\nTrump’s unilateralist action is likely to erode the trust and confidence of allies urging them to adopt hedging strategies and consider reducing their exposure and dependence on the US in the long run. Such recalibration of foreign policies may leave Washington without the firm friendships and alliances it has counted on in the past. This has strategic implications for America’s contain-China strategy especially in Asia, where allies like Japan, South Korea and others were hit hard by tariffs (even if they are now up for negotiation), some of whom were persuaded in the past to move their businesses out of China.\n\nFaced with an untrustworthy trade partner in the US, the economic imperative for countries would be to pursue trade diversion. As some commentators have pointed out, the EU, far from de-coupling, may well consider re-coupling with China. Countries will look for trade opportunities with each other and may gravitate more towards China. That top officials from China, Japan and South Korea met twice in the past fortnight to enhance ‘trilateral trade cooperation’ says much about emerging trade alliances.\nIf Trump has chosen an isolationist policy, isolation is what the US economy will end up in. The biggest beneficiary will be China even as it struggles now to limit the damage wrought by Trump’s tariff war. As Howard French wrote in Foreign Policy, “If a country has to choose a superpower to hitch its wagon to, China may loom as the preferable option” because it appears as a more moderate and stable force.\nThe consequences of the turmoil caused by Trump at home and abroad will come back to haunt his country whose international reputation has already been severely tarnished."}]}

Public protests,insurgency,militant violence,terrorism,centre-provincefriction, disputes over thesharing of waterand government-oppositionconfrontationare happening all at once. This at a time when afragile economystill has to make the transition to sustainable recovery from temporary stabilisation.\nWhat does this say about governance and the country’s leadership? That despite self-congratulatory advertisements splashed all over the media, fundamental problems wait to be tackled and governance remains way short of public expectations. Billboards across Punjab and elsewhere trying to build personality cults do not add up to leadership. Nor do PR campaigns on television, which show power holders performing routine tasks, convince many people. They have a contrary effect by indicating over-anxious efforts to elicit positive public affirmation. Appreciation is earned by performance, not posters plastered along roads or 60-page supplements in newspapers touting achievements.\nThe plethora of challenges facing the country today calls for competent and bold leadership that understands Pakistan’s deep-seated problems and has the will and capacity to solve them. Muddling through economic, political and security challenges without a coherent plan or strategy doesn’t work. Nor does it inspire public confidence about the future. Already successive public opinion polls show a nation bereft of hope in the future. An Ipsos survey released last month, for example, found 70 per cent of people felt the country was going in the wrong direction.\nPakistan has had leaderless moments before. Individuals have ascended to the country’s highest offices in the past without having the capability or any idea about how to deal with long-standing challenges. Wielding power does not translate into leadership. That is why rule has not produced governance and the gap between challenge and response has grown larger. Politics has been more about power than public purpose. Today, leadership matters even more given the enormity and complexity of the problems at hand. The present vacuum in leadership is, therefore, especially telling and more consequential than ever before.\nPakistan’s challenges need effective and visionary leaders to tackle them and break from the past.\nWhat kind of leadership does Pakistan need? What is competent leadership? What are the qualities that make effective leaders? It is, above all, having a vision that captures the public imagination and charts a way that goes beyond the moment to what is possible in the future. Effective leadership not only requires setting out a vision but also a strategy to implement it and forging national consensus to support it. Leadership means setting a clear direction, decisively embarking on a transformational path, showing courage and willingness to take risks and overcoming the resistance that inevitably comes from vested interests and entrenched elites. Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s leadership embodied these qualities and serves as an example of how impactful leaders can change the course of history. But most of those who came after him, including the current crop of leaders, have been both uninspired and uninspiring.\nLeadership also involves setting the highest standards of integrity and having an unblemished reputation for probity. It means choosing a team that embodies qualities of both competence and integrity. Indeed, putting the right people in the right job is an essential attribute of a smart leader. A team should be predicated on merit and ability, not ‘connections’, personal loyalty or considerations of political patronage. Another ingredient of leadership is the ability to connect to citizens, show empathy for their concerns, understand their aspirations and respond to them. It means winning their trust and motivating them to support the leader’s transformational agenda.\nJudged against this criterion, it is apparent how far the country’s present leaders in power fall short of this test. The lack of vision is evident. But so is the absence of a comprehensive, coherent plan to address overlapping challenges. Firefighting problems is all that has been on display, which is a stopgap approach that doesn’t solve problems. No credible strategy has been evolved, for example, to deal with Balochistan, a province in turmoil and where public disaffection has reached a record high. The dispute over the sharing of water between the Punjab and Sindh governments remains unresolved, with federal government leaders looking the other way rather than resolving the canal issue.\n\nNo vision has guided the current leadership’s economic management, which has lacked a serious effort to tackle structural problems that have landed the country in perennial financial crisis. Government leaders remain trapped in a cycle of crisis management, prioritising short-term fixes over long-term solutions, and shying away from the bold reforms needed to break the dysfunctional status quo, unlock the country’s growth potential and promote sustainable development.\nThe weak legitimacy of government leaders has denuded them of credibility because controversy over how they were elected in a disputed poll never went away. Governance has been ad hoc and characterised by short-term thinking. The bloated team chosen to run the country does have a few competent professionals, but its overall character has been determined by factors other than merit; a telling example is that top positions are occupied by those with close family connections.\nAs for another crucial attribute of leadership, which is being able to inspire people and forge a strong connection and trust with citizens, this too is conspicuous by its absence. Instead, our leaders are increasingly disconnected both from facts on the ground and the needs and aspirations of ordinary people. They have shown little ability to enthuse and unite the country. They also lack communication skills needed in today’s world to reach out to and influence citizens.\nIn his seminal book Leadership: Six Studies in World Strategy, Henry Kissinger wrote: “Ordinary leaders seek to manage the immediate; great ones attempt to raise their society to their vision.” Leaders shape history, he says, when they transcend the circumstances they inherit and carry their societies to the frontiers of the possible. Pakistan today yearns for such leadership with a vision to break from an unedifying past and create a hopeful future for the country. It’s time for citizens to make a collective effort to demand a better leadership."}]}

Escalating tensions have pushed the subcontinent into uncharted territory heightening the risk of a full-blown crisis as bilateral mechanisms are cast aside and diplomatic relations further downgraded.\nFollowing aterrorist attackin Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir, which claimed the lives of26 civilians, India announced a raft of punitivemeasuresagainst Pakistan. They included suspension of theIndus Waters Treaty(IWT), which governs the sharing and management of trans-border rivers between the two neighbours. Other steps involved closing the Attari border crossing, cancelling visas and shrinking the size of the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi.\nThese so-called retaliatory steps were taken without any investigation into the terrorist incident and absent any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement. The Indian foreign secretary’s announcement only mentioned “cross-border linkages of the terrorist attack”. But an orchestrated campaign in the Indian media pointed the accusing finger at Pakistan.\n\nMore significantly, Prime Minister Narendra Modiwarnedof “unimaginable punishment” for the attackers and their backers. This intensified speculation in India that his government was planning some kind of kinetic action to avenge the killings. It recalled memories of the2019 Balakot crisiswhen Indian planes crossed the border to launch strikes inside Pakistani territory ostensibly against militant hideouts. Pakistan retaliated by air strikes in Jammu. The crisis was defused with the help of friendly countries after Pakistan repatriated an Indian pilot captured when his plane was shot down by Pakistan.\nIslamabad’s response to India’s April 23 announcement was carefully calibrated to match Indian moves. Astatementissued after a meeting of theNational Security Committeeannounced a slew of retaliatory actions. It described Indian measures as “unilateral, unjust and irresponsible”. It rejected the Indian decision to suspend the IWT and warned any attempt “to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan” will be “considered an act of war and responded with full force”. Pakistan, it said, reserved the right to hold “all bilateral agreements with India”, including the Simla Agreement, “in abeyance” but stopped short of suspending any. Pakistan also shut down the Wagah border crossing and itsairspace to Indian overflightsas well as halted all trade. These steps mostly mirrored Indian actions.\nEscalating tensions have pushed the region into uncharted territory and towards a full-blown crisis.\nIndia’s announcement about putting the IWT “in abeyance” was not made in a vacuum. For the past several years New Delhi has been raising doubts about the fate of the 1960 treaty, that has for over six decades survived wars, confrontations and tensions to provide a framework for water-sharing.\nThe two countries disagreed in recent years over the treaty’s dispute settlement mechanism. India, for example,boycotteda court of arbitration hearing in January 2023 at The Hague on Indian hydroelectric projects on the Chenab and Jhelum rivers disputed by water-stressed Pakistan. It wanted a neutral expert instead. In January 2023, Indianotified Pakistanof its intention to amend the treaty’s dispute settlement provisions. Islamabad responded at the time by expressing willingness to discuss any concerns in the relevant body, the jointIndus Waters Commission, while calling on India to comply with the treaty.\n\nIn August 2024, New Delhiformally askedIslamabad for a review and renegotiation of the IWT. In its communication to Pakistan, India called for modifying it on grounds of what it called “fundamental and unforeseen change” in circumstances as well as security concerns. It mentioned concerns over issues including “demographic changes, environmental challenges, and the need to accelerate clean energy development”. India’s letter of April 24 to Pakistan echoed the same points but significantly added “sustained cross-border terrorism by Pakistan” as justification for putting the treaty in abeyance.\nIndia’s decision to suspend the treaty is neither consistent with treaty provisions nor international law. The treaty does not allow either party to unilaterally put it in abeyance or abrogate it. Both parties have to consent to any treaty modification or its termination according to its provisions. India’s announcement says the IWT “will be held in abeyance with immediate effect until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”.\nFor now, abeyance means India will cease sharing water flow data and exchanging information about project designs. But it already stopped doing that years ago. It can take other steps to mount pressure. But India cannot immediately halt the flow of water or significantly divert it as it lacks the infrastructure at present to do so. So, the near-term impact of this action will be limited. Of course, in the longer term it has serious implications.\nThe imminent danger is from any military action New Delhi is tempted to take, encouraged by what its officials see as ‘effective’ Indian coercive diplomacy in play, which needs reinforcement. Modi’s speech in Bihar on April 24 in which he said terrorists and their backers will be pursued to the “ends of the earth” is being widely construed as strong indication of that possibility. Speculation is running rife that conventional kinetic strikes may be combined with cyberattacks and asymmetrical actions by India.\nAlready deployment of heavy weaponry is reported close to the Line of Control and international border. Prime Minister Modi may think he can borrow from the Israeli playbook to ‘punish’ Pakistan but any Indian kinetic action will be met by a strong military response from Pakistan, with uncertain and unpredictable consequences for New Delhi. This will likely set off an escalatory cycle and trigger an all-out crisis, which could be on a larger scale thanwhat happened in 2019.\n\nIn 2019, a third party helped to defuse the crisis. Will this happen again? If no such help is forthcoming in a timely way it would make the situation between two nuclear neighbours more dangerous than in the past.\nThe notion of limited war waged under the nuclear threshold is fraught with untold risks. Such a scenario should be avoided at all costs. Even though there is little appetite for this by the Indian side, abackchannelmust be re-established without delay to avoid any miscalculation, manage the crisis and prevent it from spinning out of control. The alternative is too terrifying to contemplate."}]}

Protracted periods of diplomatic disengagement followed these crises. The bilateral impasse only deepened as, when suspended, formal dialogue was difficult to resume. Little wonder that a once promising peace process advanced through what was called the ‘composite dialogue’ was never revived since it was halted over 12 years ago.\nThe ongoing crisis has already plunged relations between the nuclear neighbours into a vortex of dangerous confrontation. Tit-for-tat diplomatic measures by both sides, initiated by India, have gone much further than actions taken in past crises. India’ssuspensionof the Indus Waters Treaty weaponises water and has far-reaching im­­plications even if its immediate impact is limited.Exchange of small-arms firecontinues along the Line of Control. The Indian Navy has been cond­u­cting long-range missile drills in the Arabian Sea, obliging Pakistan to intensify its naval activities.\nPakistani officials claim to have credible intelligence that India is preparing to launch a military strike. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statements about inflicting harsh punishment on the attackers and their backers has reinforced the possibility of kinetic action. He has given the army “operational freedom” to decide “the mode, targets and timing” of India’s response to the Pahalgam terrorist attack. War hysteria has also taken hold in India.\nThe danger of an impending military confrontation has evoked growing international concern and prompted calls for restraint. The UN secretary general,China, theUS, Saudi Arabia and Iran, among others, have urged de-escalation. Historically, the US has had leverage with both countries — and still does — to play a role in defusing crises. It did so from the 1999 Kargil conflict to the last crisis in2019. This time, contrary to speculation that Washington is too preoccupied elsewhere with other conflicts, it has engaged swiftly with both Islamabad and New Delhi to urge restraint and ask them to re-establish direct communication channels and work together to maintain peace and security.\nCan a full-blown crisis between India and Pakistan be averted?\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio conveyed this message in phone calls to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar. The same message was delivered by former national security adviser Mike Waltz to army chief Gen Asim Munir and Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, days before Waltz was removed from that post. Calls were also made to DG ISI Gen Asim Malik by CIA director John Ratcliff and director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Malik was recently appointed national security adviser, sparking speculation this was in preparation for talks later with Doval.\nWhether US intervention will dissuade India from embarking on a military course remains to be seen. Indian media reports suggest the Modi government is examining several options that can inflict pain on Pakistan but stop short of triggering a broader conflict, especially as it cannot be sure of how Islamabad will react. For its part, Pakistan has said any kinetic action by India will be met by a “strong and decisive response”. This would heighten the risk of an uncontrolled escalatory cycle with uncertain consequences and outcome. The room for miscalculation and inadvertent escalation by either side will be high in the absence of any communication between them. Messaging through an intermediary — the US — might be helpful but will not eliminate that risk.\nThe past is not a perfect guide, as no two situations are ever the same, but it may be instructive to recall what happened the last time around. The February 2019 crisis erupted after a terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pulwama district, in which 40 Indian security personnel werekilled. Blaming Pakistan for the attack, Indian officials warned of a strong response. Twelve days later, Indian Mirage jets crossed the Line of Control tocarry out a bombing raid in Balakot, claiming this destroyed ‘terrorist training camps’ and killed militants. Pakistan was to later show that the site of the bombing was a forested area and there were no casualties or damage. Pakistan retaliated by launching Operation Swift Retort entailing air strikes on a military target in Jammu. That too caused little if any damage.\nHowever, in an aerial combat an Indian Mig-21 was shot down by Pakistan and its pilot captured. His release became the key point in defusing the crisis when tensions were escalating to a dangerous level. The climax came when Pakistan determined India was about to attack having deployed and pointed nine missiles at Pakistan. This was conveyed by Pakistan’s foreign secretary to key foreign envoys including the US along with the warning that Pakistan will be compelled to retaliate. “For every Indian missile readied, three Pakistani missiles would be ready in response,” according to a former official. India therefore had to be stopped. The US was engaged at the working level with both sides, but this led to more senior-level involvement. Washington had in any case started pressing for restraint after the Indian strike in Balakot. Former secretary of state Mike Pompeo claims in his memoir Never Give An Inch that nuclear escalation became a real possibility as each side thought the other was about to deploy nuclear weapons.\nHectic shuttle diplomacy by the US and Pakistan’s effort to de-escalate the situation led to the government’s decision to release the pilot. His release provided an off-ramp from the crisis and helped to defuse it. In his book Anger Management, Ajay Basaria, former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, claims India’s coercive diplomacy produced this outcome. In a campaign speech later, Modi suggested a ‘qatal ki raat’ (night of murder) was in the offing if the pilot hadn’t been freed. Refuting Basaria’s version, Islamabad attributed the pilot’s release to Pakistan’s “responsible behaviour” in de-escalating the situation while demonstrating its capacity to respond to any security threat.\nA combination of fortuitous factors, active third-party intervention and a concrete ‘peace gesture’ in the midst of escalating tensions helped to end that crisis. Luck also played a part, as many experts have pointed out. The question is whether there are any favourable factors in play today that can halt the ongoing escalation and avert a head-on clash."}]}

Pakistan’s army chief Gen Waheed Kakar was on an official visit to Washington. Pakistan was under military and economic sanctions imposed by the US on the nuclear issue in 1990. As a result, a wide range of military equipment including 28 F16s that Pakistan had paid for was embargoed.\nAgainst this backdrop, the nuclear issue dominated most of Gen Kakar’s meetings. In one meeting with top US military and State Department officials, which I also attended as Pakistan’s ambassador to Washington, our American interlocuters offered to release all our equipment including the planes if Pakistan agreed to freeze its nuclear programme and allow a one-time inspection to verify a cap on enrichment. Gen Kakar listened patiently and then politely told his hosts: “Gentlemen, I come in friendship but we in the East do not measure our relationship in planes and tanks. You can keep our F16s and our money. Our national security is non-negotiable.”\nI recall this meeting as one example of how resolutely and uncompromisingly Pakistan maintained its position on an issue vital to its security. Had it not done so and caved into international pressure it would not have acquired the nuclear capability which is and has been the guarantor of the country’s security. There has been no all-out war between Pakistan and India since both neighbours became nuclear powers, despite regular crises, skirmishes and military confrontations.\nThelatest crisishas again thrown this into sharp relief. True, India has acted on its doctrine of limited war under the nuclear threshold, to try to push the boundaries and enlarge space for this in every successive crisis. It has also become the first nuclear power to attack another nuclear state by missiles and air strikes. It has sought to create a ‘new normal’ by launchingkinetic actionsin mainland Pakistan whenever there is aterror attackin occupied Kashmir, for which it holds Pakistan responsible without evidence.\nPakistan’s strategic capability remains the guarantor of its security against a full-scale war.\nIn the latest crisis, India used all the instruments of modern, hybrid warfare — ballistic missile strikes, drones,disinformation, psy-ops and weaponisingwaterto undermine deterrence. But Pakistan’s conventional capabilities deterred India from provoking an even larger conflict. Pakistan’s counteractions (initially downing Indian fighter aircraft) imposed heavy costs on India for its aggression. Retaliating to the second round of unprovoked Indian attacks, including on its air bases, Pakistanlauncheda military operation involving air strikes, missiles and armed drones against Indian military bases and infrastructure in and much beyond Kashmir. A ceasefire followed soon after brokered by Washington and announced by President Donald Trump.\nPakistan’s military response was designed to re-establishdeterrencewhile blunting the aims of limited war and thwarting India’s effort to seek space for conventional war under the nuclear overhang. India’s reckless actions escalated the crisis to a dangerous level and drove it into uncharted territory — almost to the edge of all-out war. But its military brinkmanship had to stop well short of Pakistan’s known nuclear red lines. Thus, were it not for the nuclear factor, a full-scale war could have broken out.\n\nThe story of Pakistan’s pursuit of a nuclear capability is worth recalling to remind ourselves of the formidable challenges that were faced — and overcome — to acquire it. Confronted with an implacable adversary Pakistan initially pursued a strategy of external balancing by forging military alliances with the West to counter India and its hegemonic ambitions.\nBut the lesson of the country’s defeat and dismemberment in 1971 was that it could only depend on itself for its security. India’s nuclear explosion in 1974 was a turning point. It convinced Pakistan of the imperative to acquire nuclear weapons. Western countries, however, sought to punish Pakistan for India’s explosion by adopting discriminatory policies and denying it technology.\nPakistan faced innumerable obstacles in its nuclear journey. It braved Western embargoes, sanctions and censure, US opposition and unrelenting international pressure to stay the course. It took the country 25 years of arduous effort to build a strategic capability and even longer to transform that into an operational deterrent with an effective delivery system. That objective could not have been achieved if successive civilian and military governments had not all pursued this regardless of costs but confident that a firm national consensus backed the effort.\nThe book Eating Grass by Feroz Khan, published some years ago, describes the fascinating interplay between geostrategic shifts, key political and scientific figures and evolution of strategic beliefs, which shaped Pakistan’s nuclear decisions. It is a riveting insider account of the country’s quest for a nuclear capability and the challenges it encountered. Its title is inspired by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s much-cited remark that if India built the bomb, “we will eat grass, even go hungry, but we will get one of our own”.\n\nKhan explains how Pakistan mastered the nuclear fuel cycle despite heavy odds. He credits this not to a few individuals but to the collective determination of hundreds of people in the civil-military establishment. However, what ultimately determined nuclear success was the cadre of scientists and engineers whose talent was tapped in the country’s early years and who were motivated by the resolve not to let India’s strategic advances go unanswered.\nA book that focuses on a different aspect of Pakistan’s nuclear journey is The Security Imperative: Pakistan’s Nuclear Deterrence and Diplomacy by Zamir Akram, an outstanding diplomat. Nuclear diplomacy played a critical role in the country’s efforts to develop a strategic capability which Akram chronicles with illuminating insights. A key theme of his book is how Pakistan’s diplomacy navigated through the discriminatory landscape erected by the West, while advancing its nuclear and missile programmes.\nAs a diplomat I witnessed first-hand the international pressure mounted on the country. Pakistan was asked to unilaterally sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, agree to inspection of its nuclear facilities, sign up to negotiations for a Fissile Material Cut Off Treaty in the UN’s Conference on Disarmament and curb its missile development. Pakistan said no to all of the above to protect its security interests.\nBecause of such decisions and the exceptional efforts of those who built Pakistan’s strategic capability its security is assured against a full-fledged war by India. Similar commitment is needed to deal with internal challenges, especially to build a strong, self-reliant economy so that the country is not vulnerable to external pressure."}]}

And never before had they edged so close to all-out war after becoming nuclear-wea­pon states.\nThe rapid escalation in the military confrontation went beyond the traditional battleground of occupied Kashmir and much further than previous crises to test deterrence. This was unprecedented but the way the crisis was defu­sed — by third-party intervention — followed a well-rehearsed path and mimicked the past.\nThe military, diplomatic and international dimensions of the crisis need to be carefully examined to make an assessment about the future. Predictably, both countries have drawn very different conclusions from the crisis. The Indian claim, voiced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is that a ‘new normal’ against terrorism has been established by India’s military actions, and that in future any terrorist attack will be deemed an act of war and responded to militarily by this ‘new’ doctrine.\n\nPakistan sees its kinetic response in the crisis to have demonstrated that conventional deterrence worked as it prevented India from escalating to an even bigger conflict and thwarted India’s effort to expand space for conventional war under the nuclear overhang. India’s loss of severalRafale aircraftsymbolised the costs imposed byPakistan’s retaliation. That and its ability to strike at multiple targets in the Indian mainland showed its conventional capabilities were able to force aceasefireand neutralise India’s aims of ‘limited war’.\nThe reality is that India failed to achieve its military objectives in the conflict in spite of Modi’s unsubstantiated assertions of having destroyed “terrorist infrastructure”. It miscalculated the consequences of its actions. Its resort to a military ‘solution’ for a terror attack backfired. The claim that a new norm has been created by India flies in the face of facts.\nThe assertion that henceforth India would respond militarily if there is another terror attack is easier said than done, given the unedifying outcome of the latest crisis for New Delhi. With the credibility of Pakistan’s conventionaldeterrence re-establishedif not strengthened, the costs for India could be even higher the next time around for it to consider similar action. India got a new normal but not the one it wanted.\nAn uneasy truce prevails between India and Pakistan with dim prospects of any diplomatic re-engagement.\nAs both countries have drawn sharply conflicting conclusions and lessons from their military confrontation this heightens the risk for miscalculation and creates uncertainty ahead, especially if sustained communication is not established between them.\n\nContact between the DGMOsafter the ceasefire has been important but the communication channel has to go beyond a technical or tactical level. There is little immediate possibility of this. This continues to make the situation fraught and unpredictable especially as Modi has declared India has “only suspended” military operations.\nThediplomatic costsof the crisis were even greater for India than the military costs. By its reckless military actions, New Delhi lost significant international ground as global attention shifted from terrorism to the danger of a full-fledged war with India climbing up the escalatory ladder. This showed how poorly the Modi government assessed the international environment. The clash brought global attention back to Kashmir, to the Modi government’s discomfiture.\nIn the biggest blow to New Delhi, President Donald Trump in announcing the ceasefireoffered to mediateon Kashmir. While this will be rejected by India, it catapults Kashmir to the global stage. India also failed to elicit any international support for its decision to suspend theIndus Waters Treaty. Even the US asked India to observe the treaty in private conversations with Indian officials.\n\nMoreover,US interventionto defuse the crisis and Trump’s statements after the ceasefire re-hyphenated India and Pakistan, which India has tried so hard over the years to delink. Former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran acknowledged to theFinancial Timesthat the crisis set back New Delhi’s efforts to dissuade countries from treating India and Pakistan “on a par, and relations with each as interlinked”. “That hyphenation is now back,” he added. If a top Indian geopolitical goal is to join the world’s big league this crisis has produced the opposite outcome for New Delhi.\nThe Modi government also misjudged the evolving American position, assuming it would receive unequivocal support from Washington for its military action to avenge the Pahalgam terror incident. But the Trump administration sought to defuse the crisis from its very onset, urging restraint on New Delhi (and Islamabad) both publicly and privately.\nAs the crisis escalated, US diplomatic intervention intensified. This was reflected in multiple phone calls made by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to top leaders in both countries and finally Vice President J.D. Vance’sintercession with PM Modiwhen the crisis looked like spinning out of control.\nThis led to the ceasefire President Trump announced and claimed credit for. The Indians neither publicly welcomed his announcement nor acknowledged the US role in ending the crisis. Modi made no mention of this in his post-ceasefire speech. Later, Indian officials refuted the US role. This contrasted sharply with the synchronous communication and close understanding between Pakistan and China throughout the crisis including in vital intelligence cooperation.\n\nAs for the political ramifications of the crisis, this provided a contrasting picture. The outcome divided India whileuniting Pakistan. Modi came under mounting domestic pressure to explain what he achieved byOperation Sindoor. His right-wing base was furious at the truce.\nWith his strongman image dented, the opposition said Modi had much to answer for while the Congress president criticised the government for “strategic missteps”. In Pakistan there wasjubilation at the outcome, rallying of national unity and renewal of national confidence while thepublic standingand reputation of the armed forces went up exponentially.\nAnuneasy trucenow prevails between India and Pakistan with a fragile ceasefire that is being implemented in phases. Confidence-building measures are being taken to reduce military tensions and the “level of alertness”. But it will be a mistake to conclude that ‘normalcy’ will return anytime soon. The outlook remains troubled and fraught with uncertainty."}]}

For good reason.\nThe slew of actions he took would certainly have troubled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Washingtonlifted sanctions on Syriaand Trumpmet with Syrian PresidentAhmad al-Sharaa in Riyadh, praising a man who previously had a US bounty on his head. Trump also praised Turkiye’s President Tayyip Erdogan, another of Israel’s adversaries, whose advice to lift sanctions he said he listened to. Netanyahu had urged Trump not to end sanctions.\nTrump also forged a truce with the Houthis in Yemen with both sides agreeing to halt military strikes against each other. This too bypassed Israel. Trump secured the release of the last remaining American hostage in Gaza after direct talks between the US and Hamas. But what would have worried Tel Aviv the most was Trump pursuing direct nuclear negotiations with Iran, which Israel vehemently opposes.\nThere are reports now of US receiving ‘new’ intelligence about Israel making preparations for a military strike on Iranian nuclear installations. If Israel takes this reckless course, it would sabotage Trump’s diplomatic efforts and damage Netanyahu’s relations with Washington, especially as Trump recently told Netanyahu in a phone conversation that talks were moving in the right direction.\nWriting in theFinancial TimesKim Ghattas saw Trump’s Middle East moves “springing surprises on Netanyahu [and] cutting Israel out of the deals it is making”. She pointed out that Trump’s patience with Netanyahu was running out even though the “decades-long alliance between Israel and the US will endure”. Other commentators referred to the Israeli prime minister being downgraded to a “spectator” during his visit as Trump moved closer to Israel’s enemies.\nDespite all this Trump has been unable or unwilling to get Israel to halt its genocidal war on Gaza even though he has long wanted a quick end to the conflict. Although the White House has warned Netanyahu he would be on his own if he continued the war, Israel has expanded its military offensive in Gaza and continued to block humanitarian aid.\nWith Palestinians being killed every day by air strikes, Netanyahu has threatened to take over all of Gaza ostensibly to “destroy Hamas once and for all”. Additional military forces have been deployed to carry out Israel’s Gideon’s Chariots offensive targeting both southern and northern Gaza, whose aim is to push Palestinians out of the strip. Hundreds of thousands are again being forced from their homes. Forcible displacement of people outside Gaza has long been Netanyahu’s aim.\nThis has created a catastrophic situation and worsened the humanitarian crisis, forcing millions of Gazans into starvation. The Israeli offensive and blockade of humanitarian aid has provoked an international outcry. UN Secretary General António Guterres called this dire situation “beyond description, beyond atrocious and beyond inhumane”. Demanding an end to the blockade he said, “The entire population is facing the risk of famine.”\n\nEven Israel’s closest Western allies lashed out against Tel Aviv. In a joint statement, France, the UK and Canada condemned Israel’s military escalation in Gaza and the West Bank, and threatened “concrete actions” including targeted sanctions, if Israel did not end its offensive and lift aid restrictions. The EU announced it would review its trade relations with Israel while countries such as Spain called for tougher action including sanctions.\nTwenty-three countries issued ajoint statementcalling on Israel to allow aid into Gaza and warning that people faced “starvation”. Under mounting pressure, Israel permitted some aid into Gaza but this was slammed as wholly inadequate by the international community.\nThe response fromAmnesty Internationalwas telling: “It is outrageous and morally reprehensible that it took the world nearly 80 days of broadcast starvation and cruelty amidst genocide to exert enough pressure on Israel to even slightly ease its total siege that has blocked the entry of all food, medicine, fuel and other vital goods.”\nMeanwhile, efforts to renew the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel aregoing nowhere at Doha. Despite the Trump administration’s unease with the lack of progress in the talks it has been unable to goad the Israelis in that direction. This seemed a factor behind US Vice President J.D. Vance’s recent decision not to visit Israel this month. Although talks have continued after Israel launched its offensive, Netanyahu has little interest in a truce. He unilaterally broke the ceasefire in March and has repeatedly declared he will not end the war until “total victory” is achieved over Hamas.\n\nThis leaves Gaza facing more bloodshed, displacement and devastation. The US-backed Israeli plan to manage and deliver aid to Gaza is hugely controversial and entails establishing a few central distribution sites where people will have to travel from long distances. These hubs will be secured by the military and private armed contractors.\nA Swiss-incorporated company, theGaza Humanitarian Foundation, will manage the centres. The UN has denounced the plan as a tool for more displacement, which is a war crime. The UN aid chief also said this makes “starvation a bargaining chip”. UN agencies have refused to be part of this arrangement. Humanitarian organisations have condemned the ‘militarisation of aid’.\nWith Israel embarked on a relentless military campaign to seize and permanently occupy all of Gaza, its far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich told a news conference the goal is to “destroy everything that’s left of the Gaza Strip” and force the population out of ‘combat zones’. From there, he said, “the population will reach the south of the Strip, and [then] move to third countries under President Trump’s plan”. Meanwhile, Netanyahu has said he will end the war only if Hamas releases all hostages andTrump’s plan to relocatethe population outside Gaza is implemented.\nIt is now incumbent on Washington to clarify ifIsraelis really carrying out Trump’s plan. This is necessary because if untrue it would put pressure on Israel to stop the offensive. If true, it would make a mockery of the image Trump is seeking to cultivate as a man of peace."}]}

India’s effort to expand the space for conventional war below the nuclear threshold did not succeed. Pakistan was able to re-establish conventional deterrence and, by its counter-attack, raise the costs for India for undertaking a reckless military adventure.\nThis has understandably been celebrated in the country and helped to renew national self-confidence. But it is important now to move past the triumphalism and focus on preparing for the next challenge which is bound to come given the unremitting confrontational stance of Narendra Modi’s government and the fact that the situation remains tense. The risk of basking too long in triumphalism is that it can breed over-confidence and complacency when another, bigger challenge may lie ahead. In fact, the moment urges the need for hard thinking, hard planning and hard work.\nPrime Minister Modi has, since the crisis ended, been stepping up his war of words against Pakistan and whipping up anti-Pakistan hysteria. In speech after speech, he has claimed India has established a ‘new normal’ by its military actions, and that any future terrorist attack will be deemed an act of war and responded to militarily by this ‘new’ doctrine. He has also made the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) central to his threats against Pakistan. Modi has repeatedly said Pakistan will not get a single drop from ‘India’s rivers’ and vowed to make Pakistan “feel the heat”. Claiming the treaty was badly negotiated, he made it clear he intends to use water as a weapon against Pakistan.\nSome of this inflammatory rhetoric is aimed at the domestic audience and is part of damage-limitation efforts after the unedifying outcome for India of its military action. Such aggressive rhetoric also has an obvious political purpose as it helps Modi burnish his anti-Muslim credentials. But his threats have to be taken seriously, especially as Modi has demonstrated he has an insatiable desire for confrontation with Pakistan. By all indications, India will keep up pressure on Pakistan and use coercive methods including threats of pre-emptive war and weaponisation of the water issue.\nIt is time to move beyond triumphalism for some hard thinking and hard planning.\nPakistan has to, therefore, be prepared to deal with a multi-front situation which means on the defence, economic and diplomatic fronts as well as in efforts to maintain national unity and cohesion. Military preparedness will obviously require identifying the gaps in defence, which may have been exposed in the latest crisis as well as areas of potential vulnerability in the next multi-domain challenge. This means upgrades of equipment that include air assets and missiles, as well as AI-powered electronic warfare and air defence capabilities, especially as the drone battle saw India deploying unmanned aerial vehicles at scale against Pakistan. Islamabad will also want to acquire J-35A fifth-generation stealth fighters from China. Increased defence spending should, however, be carefully aligned with a clear defence strategy and aim at efficient allocation of resources focused on the most critical war-fighting capabilities and priorities.\nStrengthening the economy is a sine qua non for a strong and sustainable defence. In fact, the government should leverage the India challenge to go beyond IMF-dictated adjustment measures to undertake bold, wide-ranging economic reforms. National security demands nothing less. This most important element of reform should be widening the tax base, cutting subsidies and accelerating privatisation of state-owned enterprises. Mobilising domestic resources should for once take priority over external borrowing that has already landed Pakistan with unsustainable debt. The challenge from India provides an opportunity which should not be lost to a timid, business-as-usual economic strategy. The best way to defeat any Indian design to bleed Pakistan financially through sustained military pressure is by reforms that strengthen the economy and take it towards self-reliance.\nPakistan’s response to India’s IWT threats has to be carefully assessed and calibrated as this obviously poses the greatest long-term, existential threat to Pakistan’s security. For this, all legal options have to be examined and once a course is decided it should be pursued by building the widest possible diplomatic support for Pakistan’s action. What should work in Pakistan’s favour is the fact that there is international disapproval rather than backing for India’s suspension of the treaty. In private communication even the US has urged New Delhi to observe and abide by the IWT.\nThis is also a moment when diplomacy should become the country’s first line of defence, not just in words but in deeds. It will be the diplomatic battlefield that Pakistan will have to negotiate to be able to prevail. Our diplomatic strategy should be strategic and not tactical, which is what is signalled by dispatching a delegation to a few Western capitals. Foreign policy should be about promoting strategic objectives not tactical responses. This, in fact, is an appropriate moment for a broad foreign policy review to evolve a strategic plan. All the more reason as no wide-ranging review has been undertaken since president Pervez Musharraf’s time, despite significant geopolitical shifts and changing global dynamics.\nA review will help adapt policy to changing global circumstances, leverage opportunities and reconfigure priorities in the light of the challenge from India. It will help to evaluate the effectiveness of policies, point to areas of improvement and reset policy to achieve the goals that are identified. This is especially needed as in recent years Pakistan’s foreign policy has been a series of ad hoc responses to regional and global developments rather than part of a well-considered, coherent approach. A review will also offer an opportunity to Pakistan’s diplomatic missions to make policy inputs. As the military has dominated foreign policy making in recent years a review will encourage substantive exchanges on key issues between civilian and military officials, align their views more closely and promote better coordination and information-sharing.\nThis is not an exhaustive menu of what Pakistan needs to do to ensure its security in the face of the enduring, multidimensional threat from India, but the most essential steps it must take. Above all, preserving national unity should be a top priority."}]}

Although the administration secured a temporary reprieve from an appeals court that paused the ruling, the legal battle is far from over. The appeal process has to play out and the case may even go to the US Supreme Court. Global financial markets welcomed the court order against tariffs but it leaves Trump’s trade plan hanging in the balance.\nTrump reacted furiously to the court of international trade’s decision calling it “wrong”, “political” and the “harshest financial ruling” ever. His officials went further, accusing judges of “judicial overreach” and an abuse of power to “usurp the authority of the president”. In fact, it was Trump who exceeded his emergency powers to levy global tariffs, according to the trade court. Trump hadinvokedthe International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on April 2.\nDue to the adverse market reaction to that decision, he went back and forth on tariffs, pausing them, lowering some and then raising others. This spooked investors and sowed confusion among America’s trading partners. Trump switched course when marketstankedand there was a heavy sell-off in US bonds. After the markets, it was the turn of the courts to try to restrain Trump. As theFinancial Timeswrote in a recent editorial, America’s courts are playing a salutary role by “trying to rein in what Trump regards as his limitless powers as president”.\nLegal problems have cast a shadow over Trump’s trade agenda. They may impact trade talks underway with many countries, who might see their negotiating hand strengthened by challenges Trump’s policies face from the courts. Crucial negotiations lie ahead with America’s two key trading partners, China and the EU. They can be affected by legal issues at home, even though Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have recently had apositive phone conversationon trade issues.\nAmerica’s courts are trying to restrain Trump’s unbridled use of executive power.\nWhile the tariff ruling is arguably the biggest judicial jolt to Trump’s plans, he has encountered legal setbacks on other fronts too. According to one estimate, there have been court orders against 182 of Trump’s executive actions. Some injunctions have been of a temporary nature, but they have still acted as a check on Trump’s whimsical conduct. The petitioners have mostly included state governments, cities, labour unions, civil liberties and non-profit organisations. In the tariff case, it was a group of states led by Oregon that sued the administration over its use of emergency powers without congressional action.\nCases against the administration have involved Trump’s immigration and deportation policies, his downsizing of the federal government that entailed sweeping layoffs of the workforce, freeze on foreign aid, dismantling of US agencies, birthright citizenship rights, and assaults on universities and law firms.\nAmong the most controversial of Trump’s actions to be legally challenged are the drastic cuts in the size of the federal government by large-scale firing of civil servants, ceasing funding and closing down agencies. The task of executing this plan was given to Trump’s billionaire (now estranged) friend, Elon Musk, through his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which saw over three dozen cases challenging its authority and even more lawsuits contesting funding cuts and sacking of workers. Tens of thousands of federal employees were fired while thousands were placed on forced leave or left their jobs under resignation programmes.\nA California court ruling ordered a halt to the downsizing, questioning the legality of the move. Subsequently, in another blow for Trump, an appeals court upheld that decision, forcing the administration to maintain the pause on more cuts and firings. Musk’s exit from the government throws DOGE’s future into uncertainty, even though Trump has vowed its work will carry on.\nIvy League universities have also come under mountingpressurefrom Trump’s efforts to control these institutions and suppress dissent. The administration’s battle with Harvard University has seen funding withheld, and attempts to change its governance structure and bar its ability to host foreign students. Harvard resisted and asserted its rights in the face of government intimidation by suing the federal government. Its efforts succeeded when a federal judge blocked the order revoking its right to enrol foreign students. Trump then suspended visas for six months for foreign students enrolled for study at Harvard. But this effort to circumvent the court’s ruling will only intensify the legal battle.\nCourts have issued important rulings and provided temporary relief in some cases to foreign students whose visas werecancelledor threatened owing to their pro-Palestinian sympathies. The way foreign students have been arrested — some from the streets — handcuffed and sent to detention centres, with their visas abruptly revoked, sparked an outcry in America’s academic community. A California district judge has now barred the administration from ending the legal status of international students across the country. The ruling prevents the authorities from arresting, imprisoning or moving students elsewhere based on their legal status until their case is resolved.\nTrump’s response to judicial opposition to his policies has predictably been harsh. He and his officials have vilified judges and subjected some to strong public criticism. Of course, in some notable and consequential cases, courts have also ruled in his favour. But the administration is embroiled in scores of lawsuits and it remains unclear whether Trump will comply with court orders or try to circumvent them. He has already defied court rulings, especially in immigration issues, including a supreme court order in a deportation case. How the growing clash between the executive and judiciary plays out is hard to predict, but for now America’s courts are standing up to Trump’s arbitrary actions, striking them down in key cases and acting as a check on the unbridled use of executive power."}]}

Two, it elicited international disapproval rather than support for its decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty.\nThree, re-hyphenation of the two countries that India long opposed, was evidenced most significantly in President Donald Trump’s statements, as also by others. Four, Trump made repeated claims, to India’s ire, that he secured a ceasefire to end the crisis and also offered to mediate on Kashmir. And five, international focus shifted quickly from terrorism to the danger of the crisis morphing into a nuclear flashpoint.\nThe diplomatic setback faced by India was widely commented upon in the country’s media. A columnist wrote inThe Wireabout “India’s disastrous isolation in the world”. According toThe Wire’sown analysis, “Modi’s domestic rhetoric masked a reality of India’s diminished diplomatic influence and strategic setbacks”. “All indicators,” it wrote, “suggest that the Modi government’s foreign policy failed to convert India’s military gains into sustained diplomatic advantage over Pakistan.”\nBrahma Chellaney told India Today that New Delhi lost the narrative, adding, “India’s sluggish response time [in setting the global narrative] had cost it diplomatic capital”. Several papers saw India’s diplomacy failing to convince the world about its case against Pakistan. Others spoke about “diplomatic distancing by neighbours” with India “isolated in the region”. Pakistan’s appointment to key UN counterterrorism committees was also seen as leaving “many red faces in New Delhi”, according to The Hindu and other newspapers.\nIndia’s hubristic assumption that its influence in the world would automatically translate into diplomatic advantage irrespective of how recklessly it behaved by initiating a military conflict turned out to be a strategic miscalculation. A stunning own goal was the false information and fake news it spread and its unfounded claims that seriously dented its international credibility — as indeed its credibility at home.\n\nThe Modi government’s efforts to control the narrative by relying on untruths and flights from reality only made matters worse. Constant denials that the US had helped end the conflict further damaged its credibility. What must have been particularly annoying for New Delhi was to hear Trump’s repeated praise for Pakistan’s leadership and declaring he had good relations with both countries.\nThat the Modi government had to dispatch seven multiparty delegations to scores of countries to make India’s case was acknowledgment that things had not gone India’s way at the international level. Even Western media coverage, usually sympathetic to India, was sceptical about India’s assertions and critical of its actions. The Washington Post reported on how officially orchestrated “falsehoods filled the airwaves” and “misinformation overtook Indian newsrooms” during the conflict. For their part, several Indian media outlets complained of Western media bias against their country.\nPakistan’s restraint and a series of Indian missteps gave Islamabad a decided diplomatic advantage.\nIn fact, New Delhi seemed to have set itself unrealistic foreign policy goals and made miscalculations that entailed significant diplomatic costs. Its expectation of unconditional loyalty from its friends and allies, especially the US, was unrealistic if not naïve, and that too from an administration committed to a transactional policy that prioritised America’s interests over all else.\nIn what was seen as a reprimand to the European Union, Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar said India “wanted partners not preachers” in response to the EU’s call for restraint during the crisis. Instead of eliciting Europe’s support, he arrogantly advised it to adjust to new geostrategic realities.\nHe also rebuked the British foreign secretary for equating India and Pakistan. New Delhi’s disingenuous response to Trump taking credit for the ceasefire further undermined its position. India’s effort to block the IMF executive board’s approval of funding for Pakistan was a failure foretold and only made New Delhi look foolish.\nBy its own acts of commission and omission, the Modi government found itself on the diplomatic backfoot. It misassessed the reality that there is no international appetite for a military confrontation between two nuclear neighbours that could lead to uncontrolled escalation.\nBorrowing from the Israeli playbook and applying it to South Asia would not work in a nuclearised environment\nAnd also, borrowing from the Israeli playbook and applying it to South Asia would not work in a nuclearised environment. The diplomatic outreach undertaken by its delegations fared no better. They failed to shift the needle and their clumsy approach, riddled with contradictions, did little to change international perceptions. For that reason, their conduct attracted criticism and even ridicule at home.\n\nA combination of Pakistan’s responsible exercise of restraint and a series of Indian missteps — and the contrast between the two — handed Islamabad a decided diplomatic advantage.\nThis represented quite a role reversal, as often in the past India had dominated the narrative on the international stage, reinforced, of course, by its strategic and economic importance, with Pakistan placed on the defensive. Not so this time. India’s military overreach and strategic miscalculations left it struggling to achieve its foreign policy aims. Pakistan’s measured but effective military riposte to Indian aggression and its nimble diplomatic moves enabled the country to secure an advantage over India.\nThat, however, is no reason to be complacent or assume Islamabad can maintain the diplomatic upper hand. Translating a transient advantage into a longer-term gain will require careful planning and an imaginative strategy. Its starting point — and I have argued this before — must be a wide-ranging review of foreign policy.\nIf new diplomatic opportunities have arisen from the crisis with India, these can only be seized by a well-thought-out strategy crafted after a comprehensive evaluation of the international landscape. Such a review is in any case long overdue given changing global power dynamics and geopolitical shifts.\nPakistan needs to capitalise on this moment of opportunity by resetting its foreign policy goals and evolving a strategy to match a changed international scenario — where India will pose imposing challenges on multiple fronts, but also one in which Pakistan-China strategic relations have been further fortified. It should strive to do that before the diplomatic gains reaped from its adversary’s mistakes begin to fade."}]}

By joining Israel in its military campaign against Iran, the US flouted international law and the UN Charter and plunged the region into uncharted territory, holding the danger of further escalation. It was unprecedented for two nuclear weapons states to have attacked a non-nuclear, NPT-member nation. Its lessons will not be lost on either Iran or other countries.\nDays before the US bombing, speculation had intensified that while preparations were afoot for kinetic action with American military assets moved in the region, Trump was keeping the door open for a negotiated solution. He himself said he would take a decision within two weeks, implying there was time for diplomacy. But this turned out to be a ruse and another act of deception and duplicity. As US warplanes hit Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, it blew to smithereens Trump’s claim that he wanted to be a peacemaker. It also put to shame those who believed him. In a late-night address, Trump announced the strikes were a “spectacular success” and the Iranian facilities had been “completely and totally obliterated”. He also warned Tehran that any retaliation against the US would be met with even greater force.\n\nIran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, condemned the attack as an outrageous violation of international law, which will have “everlasting consequences.” He said his country “reserved all options to defend its sovereignty and its people”. Tehran vowed to continue its nuclear programme and there is likelihood it will discontinue cooperation with the IAEA. Iran has also called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. UN Secretary General António Guterres called the US attack a “dangerous escalation in a region already on the edge and a direct threat to international peace and security”. He also pointed to the risk that the conflict could “rapidly get out of control” with “catastrophic consequences for civilians, the region and the world”.\nAlthough Iran had anticipated the US entering the war, the situation leaves its leaders with difficult options. Although Tehran warned in the past it would attack US bases and facilities and cause “irreparable damage” if Washington got directly involved in the conflict, it will not be in its interest to widen the war or risk another US attack. It will likely continue what it is already doing in response to persisting Israeli attacks. After the US bombing, Israel launched a new wave of missile assaults and Iran too doubled down on missile attacks on Israel.\nOne of the biggest casualties of the latest developments is loss of faith in diplomacy.\nWhat may be a factor in determining Tehran’s response is the extent of damage inflicted by the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities. So far Iranian officials have said there is limited damage and no danger to residents living in the vicinity of facilities attacked by US bombers. Tehran in any case had time to move some of the nuclear material elsewhere. If Iran is able to show the damage was limited and there were no casualties it can argue military retaliation against the US (for which it doesn’t have the military capacity) is unnecessary and focus instead on non-kinetic and diplomatic responses. Closing the Strait of Hormuz to disrupt shipments is an option that can send the oil price skyrocketing and spark an energy crisis. Although that has apparently been recommended by Iran’s parliament, it too entails costs which Tehran may not want to incur. So, for now, the Iranian priority might be to avoid provoking Trump into taking any more military actions.\nIf the US-Israeli escalation poses dilemmas for Iran it is also a high-risk gamble for Trump. Not only because of its unpredictable outcome but also because it could mire the US in classic ‘mission creep’ and eventually even in a quagmire with no easy way out. Although America’s disastrous Iraq experience should have served as a sobering lesson it has been willfully ignored by Washington. Trump has threatened to expand the military campaign against Iran, if necessary, that is if Tehran doesn’t accept US terms for a ‘settlement’. If ‘peace’ does not come quickly, he has said, the US will go after other targets in Iran. By this he means capitulation by Tehran and completely giving up its nuclear programme. But with Iran’s refusal to surrender the question is will the US get drawn in even more in a war of choice? If that happens it would lead to disastrous consequences both for the US and the Middle East.\nOne of the biggest casualties of the latest developments must surely be a collapse of faith in diplomacy. Who can trust Trump’s America when the administration has used subterfuge and deception right from the time it engaged Iran in Oman-mediated negotiations, ostensibly to reach a deal? From what Trump has now said it is obvious the US was all-in with Israel from the very start and was negotiating in bad faith with Iran. Referring to the Israeli prime minister, Trump said he was working with him “as a team like perhaps no team has ever worked before”.\nIsrael’s unprovoked attack on Iran on June 13 came just days before another round of talks in Oman between the US and Iran. By his own admission, Trump had advance knowledge of the Israeli assault. Not only did he do nothing to stop it but gave Netanyahu a green light to go ahead while pretending to pursue a diplomatic path. As Iran’s foreign minister put it: “Last week, we were in negotiations with the US when Israel decided to blow up that diplomacy. This week, we held talks with the E3/EU when the US decided to blow up that diplomacy.” Any return to negotiations was now meaningless, he said.\nWhile it is too early to say how the crisis will play out with the situation in such flux it is more than likely that the US-Israeli joint military campaign will, over time, push Iran to do what it can to acquire nuclear weapons capability. It has been left with no choice but to pursue that path once it is able to ride out the current crisis. This would mark an epic failure for both the US and Israel."}]}

But his imperious conduct and record so far are at sharp variance with this.\nTrue, his instincts are against war, and he vowed not to involve the US in foreign entanglements and what he called “endless stupid wars”. This is what he promised in his election campaign.\nHe alsoclaimedhe would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. During the presidential campaign, JD Vance described Trump as the “candidate of peace”. In his victory speech, Trump declared, “I am not going to start wars. I am going to stop wars.”\n\nBut in his opening days in power, his aggressive statements sent a message that no ‘man of peace’ would be identified with. He threatened to take over Greenland and the Panama Canal, if necessary by military force, and turn Canada into the 51st state of the US by using “economic force”.\nHe also said the US would “take over Gaza” and relocate Palestinians outside their homeland. He unleashed a trade war by imposing sweeping tariffs against almost all countries in the world. His bullying approach and coercive methods promptedThe Economistto describe him as a modern-day Don Corleone. Others likened his leadership style to mafia tactics both at home and abroad.\nDespite Trump’s boastful claims of bringing a quick end to the Ukraine war, he has been unable to do that. He claims to have promoted peace in the Middle East by forging a ceasefire between Israel and Iran following their 12-day war.\nBut lighting a fire and then putting it out hardly makes him a peacemaker. Israel, the aggressor, would never have attacked Iran in the first place without a green light from Washington.\nTrump acknowledged he had advance knowledge of Israel’s June 13 military assault. But he did nothing to stop Benjamin Netanyahu. Instead, he used nuclear talks with Iran as a smokescreen while the Israeli military was preparing to attack Iran.\nTrump later described the attack as “excellent” and admitted he had coordinated closely with Netanyahu. Then, in flagrant violation of international law, he ordered US warplanes to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities, declaring triumphantly this had “completely obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites and likening it to nuclear bombs dropped by the US on Japan in World War II. Is this what ‘men of peace’ do?\nTrump’s imperious conduct and record so far contradict his claim of being a peacemaker.\nPersuading Israel and Iran to agree to a ceasefire, which remains fragile, hardly supports Trump’s assertion to have established peace. Yes, the fighting has stopped for now, but peace is an altogether different matter.\nPeace is established when disputes or issues are resolved. A ceasefire is what it says it is — a halt in active hostilities. Ceasefires can, of course, be a pathway to peace. But there is no chance of peace between Iran and Israel, who remain implacable enemies. Meanwhile, Trump declared he would bomb Iran again if the country was still able to enrich uranium to weapons-grade.\nWhat contradicts Trump’s ‘peacemaker’ claim in the most barefaced way is his role in and support for Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Despite his earlier statements that he wanted an expeditious end to the war, his actions prove the contrary.\nHe has thus far shown no willingness to restrain or stop Netanyahu from raining death and destruction on Gaza. While Trump has been trumpeting his peacemaking ‘credentials’, Gaza has only seen more bloodshed, displacement, devastation, and now, starvation and famine.\nClose to 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s US-backed war, the majority of them women and children. In fact, since Trump’s assumption of power, Israel has expanded its military offensive in Gaza and threatened to occupy all of the territory.\nIt has blocked humanitarian aid and used starvation as a weapon. Has Trump intervened to prevent any of this or, for that matter, Israel’s increasing military assaults on the occupied West Bank?\nObviously not. Instead, the US has used its veto to block resolutions in the UN Security Council calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The most recent veto was exercised earlier this month that opposed an “immediate and permanent ceasefire”; it was the sixth US veto since the war began.\nThis has given Israel carte blanche to continue its killing spree and create a catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The Trump administration has remained unmoved by scenes of desperate, starving Palestinians, including children, being shot in cold blood by Israeli forces as they queue up for food at controversial military-run aid distribution sites set up with US backing.\nIn one month alone, over 500 aid-seekers have been killed. Washington has also not denied Israeli leaders’ claims that they are implementing Trump’s plan of forcible displacement of Palestinians by pushing them out of Gaza.\nDespite this grim record, Trump feels he should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Although he has cited several reasons for this, his claim rests principally on brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after their four-day conflict.\nFor that, the government of Pakistan recommended him for the Nobel Peace Prize. This ill-conceived move, aimed at ingratiating itself with Trump, was justified by the government on the grounds that he had intervened to de-escalate “a rapidly deteriorating situation” and secure a ceasefire that averted “a broader conflict between the two nuclear states”.\nIt is disingenuous to argue Trump’s intervention was the decisive factor, when it was nuclear deterrence that prevented the outbreak of all-out war.\nDefusing a crisis, which Washington did, is not the same thing as averting a full-blown conflict. If it took Trump to avert a “broader conflict”, that would make Pakistan’s nuclear capability irrelevant.\nIf that is what the government thinks, then it has no confidence in the country’s security guarantor. Moreover, a peace award should be in recognition of the establishment of peace, which happens when contentious issues are resolved between warring parties. Has that happened?\nWhat is touted as Trump’s doctrine of ‘peace through strength’ is nothing other than the unilateral use of force and coercion in defiance of international law and global norms to impose US will. This is a recipe for chaos, not winning the peace."}]}
